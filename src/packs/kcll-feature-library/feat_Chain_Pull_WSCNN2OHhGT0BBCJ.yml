    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, as bonus action, you can force all Large or
      smaller creatures of your choice within range of your primal interdiction
      to make a Dexterity saving throw against 8 + your Strength or Wisdom
      modifier (your choice) + your Proficiency bonus. On failure, they are
      grappled by chains as per your Binding Interdiction feature. Chains
      created by this feature do not count against your maximum number of
      chains. You can choose to pull creatures that fail their saving throw to
      the closest available space to you when they fail their save.</p><p>Once
      you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short
      or long rest.</p>
