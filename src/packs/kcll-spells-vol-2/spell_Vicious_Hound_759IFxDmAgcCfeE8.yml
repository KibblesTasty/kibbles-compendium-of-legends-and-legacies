  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon an illusion of a particularly vicious hound that chases a
      target within range. Only the target can see the hound. On each of its
      turns for the duration of the spell, if it moves less than 40 feet from
      where it started their turn, it takes 3d8 psychic damage as it gets mauled
      by the illusionary hound. At the end of each of its turns, regardless if
      took damage or not, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it
      discerns the hound is an illusion and the spell ends.</p>
