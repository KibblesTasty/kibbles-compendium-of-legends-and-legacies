  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, when you use your Wild Shape feature to take on
      the form of a beast, you retain your ability to speak (as long as the
      beast would normally be able to vocalize sounds at sufficient volume to do
      so), and become more dexterous and adaptable with paws, claws, or talons,
      allowing you to use them perform more complicated tasks that might
      otherwise require hands. You additionally retain the ability to cast
      spells while using Wild Shape to turn into a
      beast.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Spellcasting Beasts</strong> </p><p>The
      civilized beasts feature means that you would be able to cast spells
      (performing verbal and somatic components) while wild shaped (among other
      uses, such as talking to your parties and performing side talking animal
      circus side show acts.</p></blockquote>
