      <p>Additionally at 1st level, the touch of the divine inside of you has
      opened up new pathways of magic and understanding that most cannot
      comprehend—a connection to magic. Select one of the following mysteries:
      Darkness, Death, Fire, Life, Light, Nature, Souls, or War. Spells learned
      from your Mystery are Occultist spells for you, but do not count against
      your spells known. </p><p>Some oracles are burdened with too much power
      for their mortal body. Optionally you can select to be one of these by
      selecting the “Oracle’s Curse” feature, gaining an additional divine boon
      and curse. </p><p>You can select an additional Mystery at 5th (two
      Mysteries) and again at 11th level (three Mysteries).</p>
