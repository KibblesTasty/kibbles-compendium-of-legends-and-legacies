  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Additionally at 2nd level, from operating within the confines of a
      city, you have managed to tame your magic to more freely operate within
      the limitations of tight urban environments. When you cast a spell that
      targets an area of effect, you can exclude a 10-foot cube from the area of
      effect (the cube does not have to be entirely within the area of
      effect).</p><p>Alternatively, you can reduce the area of effect of any
      spell down to any value between its area of effect and a 5-foot radius,
      and can cast spells that would otherwise not be able to manifest in the
      environment (such as casting call lightning in a room less than 60 feet
      tall), with your spells adapting to fit within your environment.</p>
