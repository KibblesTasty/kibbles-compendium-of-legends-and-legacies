    value: >-
      <p>You gain more granular control over your body, even when it is not all
      attached, allowing it to take advantage of its unnatural properties. You
      gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong> Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ability
      score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Removable Parts.</strong>
      You can remove a limb and continue to control it. It gains the statistics
      of a Crawling Claw, but has a blindsight of 5 × your proficiency bonus
      instead of 30 feet. This crawling claw gains all the abilities of a
      familiar as per the find familiar spell. You lose use of the limb for
      anything else while it is not attached. If it is destroyed, you can attach
      a new limb over the course of a long
      rest.</li><li><strong>Dullahan.</strong> Being beheaded (for example, by a
      vorpal sword) is no longer fatal to you, though your body cannot move more
      than 120 feet from your head.</li></ul>
