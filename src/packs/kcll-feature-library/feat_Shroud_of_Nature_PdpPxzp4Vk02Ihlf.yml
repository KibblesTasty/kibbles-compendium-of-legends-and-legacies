      <p>Starting at 7th level, you and your allies can fade away behind natural
      shrouds. Whenever you cast a spell that results in you or a friendly
      creature becoming obscured (such as being within the radius of a fog cloud
      or behind earth moved by mold earth), the obscured creature can use their
      reaction to take the Hide action.</p>
