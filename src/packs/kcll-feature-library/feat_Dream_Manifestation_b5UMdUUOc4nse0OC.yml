      <p>Starting at 6th level, as an action you can manifest parts of your
      dreams into the real world as fleeting creations within a 20-foot cube
      within 30 feet of you. You can create an object (such as a chair or bed),
      structure (such as a small empty house, a bridge, or stairs), or creature
      this way, but whatever is created must fit within a 20-foot cube.
      Creatures created this way are illusionary, behaving as per the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.nslx2nT3p4lNkmdp]{major image} spell,
      but objects and effects can be made real with the following
      limitations:</p><ul><li><strong>Magical Nature.</strong> Objects and
      structures created this way are obviously magical in nature and crumble to
      nothing after 1 minute.</li><li><strong>Unreal.</strong> They have no
      value, and cannot be moved outside of the 20-foot cube they were made
      in.</li><li><strong>No Information.</strong> They cannot contain any
      information you don’t yourself know (for example a book on a subject you
      don’t know would be blank).</li><li><strong>Durability.</strong> Objects
      created this way have an AC equal to your Cleric level and crumble to dust
      if they take any damage. They cannot deal any damage, crumbling to dust if
      they would deal damage.</li></ul><p>Once you use this ability, you cannot
      use it again until you complete a long rest, though you can use it again
      early by expending a 3rd-level spell slot.</p>
