    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain
      area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm
      spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a
      Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
      damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you
      fail.</p>
