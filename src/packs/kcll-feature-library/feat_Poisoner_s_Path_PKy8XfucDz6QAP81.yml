      <p>You gain proficiency (or expertise if you already have proficiency)
      with the poisonerâ€™s kit. During a long rest, you can create a long lasting
      poison for one or more weapons for free. Until the end of your next long
      rest your Sneak Attack damage with that weapon becomes Poison damage and
      creatures struck with it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC
      of 8 + your Proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier or become
      &amp;Reference[Poisoned] for one minute. Creatures poisoned this way make
      a new save at the end of each of their turns, ending the condition on
      success. Once a creature passes the save against this effect, it cannot
      suffer the Poisoned condition from it again for 24 hours.</p>
