      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, your link to a mystical spirit grants you
      the ability to use certain magic through it. Your Spirit Weapon counts as
      an arcane focus, and is considered worth the value of the weapon it takes
      the form of when being used as a material component for
      spells.</p><h5>Spell Slots</h5><p>The Spiritsworn table shows how many
      spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast
      one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or
      higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long
      rest.</p><h5>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h5><p>You learn two
      spells of your choice from the Spiritsworn spell list. You gain additional
      spells based on the spirit’s aspect, listed at the end of this class. The
      Spells known column shows when you learn more spells of 1st level or
      higher. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of
      the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the Spiritsworn
      spell list. Spells gained from the spirit’s aspect cannot be replaced. The
      new spell must be of a level for which you have spell
      slots.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Your spell casting ability is
      Wisdom, with your spells being an expression of bond with a spirit. You
      use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
      addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC
      for spells you can cast, and when you make an attack roll with
      one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
      your Wisdom modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your
      proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
