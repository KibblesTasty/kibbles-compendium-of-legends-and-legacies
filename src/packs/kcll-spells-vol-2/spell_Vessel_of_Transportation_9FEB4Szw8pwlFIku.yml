  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You weave together creation magic and conjure a vehicle of your choice
      within range, which uses the
      @UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-monsters.Actor.a1BQNuXf3RWYOW3J]{Magical
      Vessel} stat block. The vehicle can take any shape you wish, but is no
      more than 10 feet on any side.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you can
      designate any number of creatures you can see as pilots. A pilot inside
      the vehicle can attempt to mentally control it as an action, unless
      another pilot is already controlling it. The pilot can end this control at
      will (no action required), or its control ends automatically if it exits
      the vehicle.</p><p>While in control of the vehicle, the pilot is deaf and
      blind to its surroundings. Instead, it sees and hears through an invisible
      sensor that follows the vehicle and hovers 5 feet outside of it at all
      times. The pilot move the sensor as a bonus action to another location
      within 5 feet of the vehicle.</p><p>If a pilot is mentally controlling the
      vehicle, you can terminate its control as an action. As part of the same
      action, you can choose to become the new pilot of the vehicle.</p>
