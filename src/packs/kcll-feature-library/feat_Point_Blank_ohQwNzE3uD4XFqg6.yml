    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 7th level, when you use Spellstrike while grappling a
      target, you can instead infuse the target with the spell, treating the
      spell as if you’d automatically hit an infused attack. The target can
      still save against effects beyond damage, but any saving throw is made
      with disadvantage.</p>
