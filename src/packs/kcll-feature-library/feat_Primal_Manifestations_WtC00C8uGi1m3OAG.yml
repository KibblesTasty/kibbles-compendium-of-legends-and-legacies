      <p>Starting at 3rd level, your connection to the primal forces youâ€™ve
      bonded with develop in new ways, unique to you, that grant you new powers
      and abilities.</p><p>You gain two such Primal Manifestations selecting
      from the list at the end of the class description. When you gain certain
      Warden levels, you gain additional manifestations of your choice, as shown
      on the Warden Class Table. </p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in
      the class, you can choose one of the manifestations you know and replace
      it with another manifestation that you could learn at that level. If a
      manifestation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn the
      manifestation. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this
      class.</p>
