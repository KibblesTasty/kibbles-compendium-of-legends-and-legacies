    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level when you select this archetype, you become
      permanently bonded to a special spirit that can manifest into the form of
      any weapon or pair of weapons you are proficient with. You can manifest
      the spirit as a bonus action, and it lasts until you spend a bonus action
      to return it to its intangible form. The spirit is typically intangible
      and imperceptible to anyone other than you when not
      manifested.</p><p>While it is manifested, you can change its form as a
      bonus action. If you are ever more than 300 feet from the weapon, or enter
      a different plane, the spirit returns to you in its intangible form, while
      its weapon form vanishes.</p><p>If the spirit manifests as a ranged
      weapon, it manifests with one piece of ammunition already loaded. Further
      attacks require ammunition (and loading, if applicable) as necessary. Each
      time you change the form of your Spirit Weapon, it reforms in your
      hand.</p><p>As part of a long rest, the spirit can absorb a magic weapon
      as long as that weapon is not a sentient weapon. When it does so, the
      spirit gains any bonus to attack and damage rolls that weapon has, and can
      perfectly imitate that weapon (though only gains any property other than a
      bonus to attack and damage rolls when mimicking the absorbed weapon). It
      can have one weapon absorbed in this way at a time, and absorbing a new
      weapon returns the previously absorbed weapon.</p>
