      <p><em>(Prerequisite: 5th-level Hedge Mage)</em></p><p>Even as you gain
      power, you are adept with using it small bursts for simple magic. You can
      sacrifice a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to gain two 1st level spell
      slots. If the spell slot is 5th level or higher, you can gain 2nd level
      spell slots. You cannot store more than twice your usual maximum number of
      any spell slot level this way.</p>
