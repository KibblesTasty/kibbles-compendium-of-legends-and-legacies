      <p>When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with Void Gaze, you can
      immediately use the ability again targeting another creature within range
      as part of the same action. You can do this a maximum number of times in a
      turn equal to your proficiency bonus ([[lookup @prof]]).</p>
