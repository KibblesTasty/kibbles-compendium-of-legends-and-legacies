  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You assume an immutable form. You become immune to other transmutation
      spells or magical effects that would alter your form. </p><p>If you don’t
      move during your turn, you gain advantage on Strength or Constitution
      saving throws made before the start of your next turn, and cannot be moved
      or knocked down against your will. </p><p>While the spell is active, as a
      reaction to taking bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage you can gain
      resistance to that damage type (Including the triggering damage) until the
      end of your next turn, but your movement speed becomes zero until the end
      of your next turn.</p>
