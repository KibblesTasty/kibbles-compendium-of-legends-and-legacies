      <p>You have mastered wielding weapons with lightning speed, granting the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Quick Draw.</strong> Whenever you
      make an attack, you can draw a light melee weapon as part of taking the
      attack.</li><li><strong>Twin Strike.</strong> When you make an attack
      while wielding more than one light melee weapon and make an attack with
      one of them, you can subtract the damage dice of another light melee
      weapon you are carrying from the attack roll to add twice its damage dice
      to the damage roll of that attack on hit.</li></ul>
