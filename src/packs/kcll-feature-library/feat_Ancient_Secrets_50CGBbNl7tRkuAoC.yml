    value: >-
      <p>When you select this Patron at 1st level, you can access the ancient
      secrets your patron has granted you. By expending a pact magic spell slot
      of at least one level higher than the spell you want to cast (or a
      1st-level spell slot for a cantrip), you can cast an Abjuration,
      Divination, or Transmutation spell that does not appear on your spell
      list. This spell can be from any class’s spell list, but counts as a
      Warlock spell for you when you cast it this way. Spells cast this way are
      cast at one level lower than the spell slot used.</p><p> You can do this a
      number of times equal to your spellcasting modifier, and regain all uses
      of this feature at the end of a long rest.</p>
