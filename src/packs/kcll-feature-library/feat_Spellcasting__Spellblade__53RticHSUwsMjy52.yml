      <p>As part of your study of magic, you gain the ability to cast spells at
      2nd level. The spells you learn are limited in scope, primarily concerned
      with enhancing your abilities and devastating your
      foes.</p><h2>Cantrips</h2><p>At 2nd level, you learn two additional
      cantrips of your choice from the Spellblade spell list. You learn
      additional Spellblade cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown
      in the Cantrips Known column of the Spellblade table. The table includes
      the bonus cantrips gained from Spellblade class features (such as
      Empowered Strike).</p><h2>Spell Slots</h2><p>The Spellblade table shows
      how many spell slots you have to cast your Spellblade spells of 1st level
      and higher. To cast one of your Spellblade spells, you must expend a slot
      of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
      you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Spells Known of 1st Level and
      Higher</h2><p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the
      Spellblade spell list. The Spells Known column of the Spellblade table
      shows when you learn more Spellblade spells of your choice.</p><p>Each of
      these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For
      instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new
      spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in
      this class, you can choose one of the Spellblade spells you know and
      replace it with another spell from the Spellblade spell list, which also
      must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p

      proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p><p
      style="text-align:center"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your
      proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p><h2>Spellcasting
      Focus</h2><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your
      Spellblade spells. </p>
