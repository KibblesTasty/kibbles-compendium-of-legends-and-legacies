    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, the steed gains advantage on any saving throw or
      ability check to resist forced movement. In cases where the steed is
      subjected to forced movement, the rider automatically succeeds their save
      to stay mounted. </p><p>Additionally, if the rider would be knocked off
      the steed by forced movement targeting the rider, the steed can use their
      reaction to move up to their movement speed to the location the rider
      would be knocked. If the steed can move to the new position with the
      reaction, the rider stays mounted.</p>
