    value: >-
      <p>You summon clinging plant growth in four 15-foot squares you can see
      within range, and a snarling carnivorous plant in the central space of
      each area. Each 15-foot square is difficult terrain. When you cast the
      spell, each plant makes one attack against a creature of your choice
      within 5 feet of it. The plants make melee spell attacks with your spell
      attack modifier, dealing 2d8 piercing damage on hit. </p><p>If a creature
      ends its turn within 5 feet of one or more of the carnivorous plants, the
      plants automatically attack that creature unless you use your reaction to
      prevent them from doing so. </p><p>The plants have AC 14 and 30 hit
      points, and have vulnerability to fire and slashing damage. Each plant
      regains all its hit points at the start of your turn if it has at least 1
      hit point, and dies if it is reduced to zero hit points. When the spell
      ends, the difficult terrain disappears, except where the plants themselves
      were. This difficult terrain also disappears if the plant was killed with
      fire damage. </p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this
      spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can summon 1
      additional carnivorous plant for each slot level above 4th.</p>
