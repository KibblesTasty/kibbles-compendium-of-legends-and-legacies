      <p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain an alternate use for
      Wild Shape. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to
      invoke primal powers to manifest elemental forces at a point within 60
      feet. When you invoke this power, select an element to invoke, which has a
      different effect.</p><ul><li><strong>Air: Coalesced Lightning.</strong>
      Creates a crackling ball of energy at the target point. When you manifest
      the power, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can force one
      creature within 30 feet of the point to pass a Dexterity saving throw, or
      be struck by an arc of lightning, taking 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier
      damage.</li><li><strong>Earth: Stone Pillar.</strong> When you manifest
      the power, a stone eruption fills an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the
      point, rising up to 10 feet and blocking the space. It has an AC of 16 and
      hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level. The pillar is
      three quarters cover for creatures behind it. It becomes difficult terrain
      when destroyed.</li><li><strong>Fire:</strong> Wildfire. The area within 5
      feet of the point is filled with flames. Creatures that start their turn
      in the area take 1d6 fire damage.</li><li><strong>Water:</strong> Icy
      Blizzard. The area within 5 feet of the point is filled with an icy storm
      of sleet, becoming difficult terrain.</li></ul><p>You can move an
      elemental manifestation up to 20 feet on subsequent turns as a bonus
      action. If you move a stone pillar, the pillar is destroyed and you can
      create a new pillar.</p><p>Instead of moving a Wildfire or Icy Blizzard,
      you can expand their radius by 5 feet as a bonus action. You can use this
      on a manifestation a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.
      Their radius is reset to the base size if you move them. You are
      unaffected by the effects of your own elemental manifestations (though
      cannot move through stone pillars you create unless otherwise able
      to).</p><p>The manifested elemental lasts for 1 minute, ending early if
      you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this
      feature again.</p>
