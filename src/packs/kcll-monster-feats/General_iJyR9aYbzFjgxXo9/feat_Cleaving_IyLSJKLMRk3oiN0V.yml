  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The monster excels at engagements against groups of creatures, and can
      maximize the value of its first swing on each turn to mow through targets.
      This feat is most appropriate for creatures larger than the PCs, brutes,
      or creatures that wield large weapons with high strength. It gains the
      following feature:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Wild Cleave.</strong> The first
      time on its turn the creature attacks while more than one creature is
      within range, it rolls a [[/r d4]]. It targets a number of creatures in
      range of its choice up to a maximum of the value rolled with its first
      attack.</p></li><li><p><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong> +Â½</p></li></ul>
