  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This is a feat given to a group of monsters to turn them in a deadly
      cohesive unit. It is a simple feat that does not individually impact CR
      significantly, but greatly increases the multiplicative power of a group
      of monsters. It works best as a feat representing the coordination of
      monsters being controlled by a tactical being or commander. It grants the
      following feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Legion Assault.</strong> The monster
      has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the
      monster's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and isn't incapacitated.
      They roll one additional die as part of that advantage for each additional
      ally within 5 feet.</li><li><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong> +½</li></ul>
