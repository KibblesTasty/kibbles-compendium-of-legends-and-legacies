      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can cast a spell with the ritual tag without
      knowing that spell. When you do so, it takes the additional time as if
      casting it as a ritual, but still consumes a spell slot. You can improvise
      spells of a level equal to one-third of your Occultist level (for example,
      a 3rd level Occultist can improvise 1st level rituals).</p>

      <p>Spells improvised this way can be from any spell list, but if it is not
      on the Occultist list, you must have seen the spell been cast or otherwise
      seen the spell in a written form.</p>
