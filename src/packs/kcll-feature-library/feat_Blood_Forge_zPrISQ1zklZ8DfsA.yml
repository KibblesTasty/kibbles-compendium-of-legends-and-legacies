    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, when you roll initiative or as a bonus action at
      any time, you can forge your blood into armaments. You can conjure up to
      two weapons, or a weapon and a shield at the same time in this way.
      Weapons and shields created this way are automatically equipped as part of
      conjuring them, and can be dismissed at any time (no action required).
      Shields act as a normal shield would, while weapons depend on the
      properties selected from the Blood Forged Weapon table below.</p><p>If you
      become bloodied (reduced to half your maximum hit points or less), your
      Blood Forged weapons deal 1d4 additional necrotic damage. The size of this
      die increases at 5th (to 1d6), 11th (to 1d8), and 17th (to 1d10)
      level.</p><h5 id="blood-forged-weapon-table">Blood Forged Weapon
      Table</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Properties</th><th>Damage

      necrotic</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The damage die of these weapons are
      increased by any Warden class feature that increases the damage die of
      natural weapons. If the damage die of any d6 weapon is increased to a d8,
      it instead becomes 1d4 slashing and 1d4 necrotic damage. When the damage
      die of any weapon with multiple dice increases, you can select which
      damage die to increase.</p>
