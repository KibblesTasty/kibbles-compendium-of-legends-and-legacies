  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You and another willing creature become permanently bonded together by
      a magical connection. Any damage taken or healing done to either creature
      is split between the two creatures. Either creature can transfer their hit
      points to the other creature by touching them as an action if the other
      creature has less hit points than they do (up to an amount that would
      equalize their hit points).</p>
