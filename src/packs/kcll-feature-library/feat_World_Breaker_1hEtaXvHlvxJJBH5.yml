      <p>Starting at 14th level, you can cast fissureK without expending a spell
      slot. Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you complete a long
      rest.</p><p> You can use it again early by expending 5 or more charges of
      Seismic Backlash, casting fissureK in place of unleashing the normal
      effect. Spending additional charges increases the level of it is cast by 1
      level per additional charge spent.</p>
