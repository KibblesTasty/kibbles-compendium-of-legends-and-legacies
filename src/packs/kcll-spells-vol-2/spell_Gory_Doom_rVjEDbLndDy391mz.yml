    value: >-
      <p>When a creature that has flesh, blood, or bone that you can see is
      reduced to 0 hit points, you can attempt to make it explode in a shower of
      gore. If the target is still alive and merely unconscious, it must make a
      Constitution saving throw. On a success, it does not explode, but suffers
      one death saving throw failure if applicable.</p><p>If the target is dead
      or fails its saving throw, it violently explodes in shards of flesh,
      blood, and bone. Each creature within 10 feet must make a Dexterity saving
      throw. A creature takes 3d6 necrotic damage on a failure or half as much
      damage on a success.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you
      cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage
      increases by 1d6 for each level above 2nd.</p><section
      id="secret-GNRp6t0aPLJlfxdZ" class="secret"><h5>Foundry Note</h5><p>Both
      activities are set up to consume the hit points and spell slot; if it's a
      living target that fails its saving throw, just un-check the consumption
      for the explosion.</p></section>
