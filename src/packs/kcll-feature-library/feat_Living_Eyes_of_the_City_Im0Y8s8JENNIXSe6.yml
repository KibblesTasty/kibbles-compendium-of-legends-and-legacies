    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, when you cast
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.hDOENzjuj5WpLq7B]{animal friendship},
      you can target up to a dozen animals of the same type when targeting tiny
      creatures (such as cats, rats, pigeons, or similar). When a tiny animal is
      charmed in this way, they can understand you in a limited capacity (such
      as where something you can describe in terms they would understand is),
      you can understand them in a limited capacity (such as which direction
      something is), and will lend you aid in simple tasks as long as it does
      not place them in danger. They can be convinced to take on greater risks
      with an appropriate Animal Handling check with the DC determined by the
      DM.</p><p>Additionally, any familiar you summon with find familiar gains
      the ability to communicate with creatures of a type resembling the form it
      takes, and has advantage on all Animal Handling checks while interacting
      with beasts it can communicate with. You can expend a use of your Wild
      Shape feature to shift your familiar from one form it can take to another
      without having to resummon it as a bonus action.</p>
