      <p>As a ritual that takes 1 hour, you can form a coven bond with one
      willing creature. While both of you are conscious and within 120 feet of
      each other, you gain the ability to share spell slots up to a maximum
      spell slot of your Witch level divided by four (rounded down).
      </p><p>While this bond is active, you can use your Spellcasting feature to
      cast using their spell slots (consuming them as normal), and they can use
      their Spellcasting feature (if they have one) to cast using your spell
      slots (consuming them as normal). </p><p>Additionally, you know their
      location at all times while they are part of your coven and within 120
      feet of you. You can only be bonded to one creature with this bond at a
      time. You can end this coven at any time.</p>
