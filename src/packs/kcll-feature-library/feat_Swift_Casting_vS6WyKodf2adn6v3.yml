      <p>Starting at 3rd level you can use Spellstrike as part of the Attack
      action before making a melee weapon attack. You cannot Spellstrike more
      than once per turn.</p><p> Additionally, you can use a melee weapon as
      your arcane focus, and when you do so you can perform somatic components
      with the hand holding your arcane focus (even for spells without a
      material component).</p>
