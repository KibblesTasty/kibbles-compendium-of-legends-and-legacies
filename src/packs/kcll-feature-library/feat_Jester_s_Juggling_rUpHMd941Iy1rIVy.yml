      <p>When you join the College of Fools at 3rd level, you master the art of
      juggling almost anything. You gain proficiency in Performance (or another
      skill of your choice if you already proficient in it).</p><p>Additionally,
      you can draw or stow any number of items or weapons during your turn. You
      can hold more weapons or objects than you have hands, but when you do so,
      at the end of your turn you must make Dexterity (Performance) check with a
      DC of 5 times the additional number of hands you need to wield or hold all
      the items you are holding (for example, to hold 3 daggers would be a DC 5,
      while to hold 3 daggers and greatsword would be DC 15). On failure, you
      drop any that you donâ€™t have sufficient hands to hold.</p>
