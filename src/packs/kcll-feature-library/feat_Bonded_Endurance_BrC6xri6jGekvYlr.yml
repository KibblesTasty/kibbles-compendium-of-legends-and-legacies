      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you can use Endurance Dice to reduce damage
      taken by your Bone Construct. When you do so, you gain temporary hit
      points equal to the value rolled on the die. When you block damage with an
      Endurance Die against yourself, your Bone Construct gains temporary hit
      points equal to value rolled on the die.</p>
