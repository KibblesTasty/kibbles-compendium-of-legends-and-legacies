    value: >-
      <p>You master the effective use of a pike, making the most of its extreme
      range.</p><ul><li><strong>Extended Reach.</strong> Your reach with a pike
      increases by 5 feet on your turn.</li><li><strong>Set for Charge.</strong>
      If you havenâ€™t yet moved this turn, you can use your bonus action to set
      for charge, reducing your movement speed to 0 and gaining a second
      reaction that can only be used to make attacks of opportunity until the
      start of your next turn.</li><li><strong>Zone Control.</strong> While
      wielding a pike, creatures provoke an attack of opportunity when they
      enter the reach of the pike.</li></ul>
