    value: >-
      <p>When you gain your Spirit Weapon, your ability and prowess at fighting
      becomes linked to it. Whenever you manifest your spirit, you can change
      your Fighting Style to apply to the weapon type it has formed as (for
      example, if you form it as a rapier, you can gain the Dueling Fighting
      Style). You may revert your Fighting Style to its original choice when you
      dismiss your Spirit Weapon.</p>
