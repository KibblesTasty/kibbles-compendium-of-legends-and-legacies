    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, the doggo gains exceptional awareness and
      cleverness when using the tools of its pack. Its intelligence score
      increases by 2 to a maximum of 20, and it can count its mouth as a free
      hand for the purposes of using and administering potions, healing kits,
      etc.</p><p> It gains proficiency in light and medium armor (though can
      only wear barding made to fit it), simply melee weapons, and one tool of
      its choice</p>
