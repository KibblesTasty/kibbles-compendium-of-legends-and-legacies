      <p>Additionally at 7th level, you can add your proficiency modifier to the
      DC of any check made to escape the restrained condition you caused on a
      creature that you do not already add your proficiency to (for example,
      tied ropes, shackles, nets, etc). Additionally, you have advantage on
      skill checks to tie knots or secure ropes.</p>
