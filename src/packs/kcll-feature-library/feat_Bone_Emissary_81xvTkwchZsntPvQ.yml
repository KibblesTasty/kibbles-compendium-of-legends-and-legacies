      <p>Starting at 3rd level, your Bone Construct gains its own Primal
      Interdiction extending to a range of 5 feet around it.. When you
      recklessly defend your allies within range of your Primal Interdiction,
      your Bone Construct does the same for any creatures within the range of
      the Primal Interdiction emitting from it.</p>
