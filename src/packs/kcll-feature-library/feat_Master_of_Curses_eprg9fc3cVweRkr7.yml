    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, you no longer need the material component for
      curse spells (even when casting them at range).</p><p>Additionally,
      casting 1st level Hex or Curse spell no longer interrupts or is
      interrupted by concentration of other spells, though this cannot let you
      concentrate on more than two spells at a time, with at least one being a
      1st level Hex or Curse. If you lose concentration while you are doing
      this, concentration is lost on both spells.</p>
