      <p>Starting at 10th level, your frequent exposure to the fey makes you
      immune to the charmed condition. Additionally, when a creature attempts to
      charm you or attack you, as a reaction you can force them to make a Wisdom
      saving throw against your Warlock spell save DC, or become
      &amp;Reference[charmed] by you instead for 1 minute. A creature that is
      charmed this way by you can repeat their saving throw at the end of each
      of their turns, and the charm effect ends if they take damage.</p><p>Once
      you charm a target with this feature, you cannot use it again until you
      complete a long rest. You can use it again early by expending a use of Fey
      Burst.</p>
