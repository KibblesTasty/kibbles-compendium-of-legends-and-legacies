      <p>Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can expend one use of
      your Wild Shape feature to sprout a Sapling, rather than assuming a beast
      form. The Sapling to sprouts to life in an empty space you can see within
      30 feet. The Sapling is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your
      commands. See this creatureâ€™s game statistics in the Sapling stat block,
      which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p><p>In combat,
      the Sapling shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn
      immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge
      action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take
      another action. You can command your Sapling as part of the same bonus
      action used to summon it. That action can be one in its stat block or some
      other action. If you are incapacitated, the Sapling can take any action of
      its choice, not just Dodge. When you cast a spell with a range other than
      self, the spell can originate from you or your Sapling.</p><p>The Sapling
      manifests for 10 minutes, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you
      use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.</p>
