      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke a special ritual as an action,
      creating an ethereal orrery representing an accurate real time star chart
      around you, even during the day or underground. While surrounded by your
      Astral Orrery, you are able to see the positions of the stars and
      celestial bodies in great detail, even during the day, and gain the
      following abilities:</p><ul><li><strong>North Star.</strong> You can
      determine which direction is north and what time of day it
      is.</li><li><strong>Celestial Navigation.</strong> You can gain advantage
      or grant advantage to another creature on making Wisdom (Survival) checks
      to determine your location,</li><li><strong>Read the Heavens.</strong> You
      can cast the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.4v2H3hHb3Ph9XLNd]{augury}
      spell as a ritual, consulting astral omens, even without having the spell
      known or prepared.</li></ul><p>This ability may have unpredictable results
      or not function as expected when used on planes other than the material.
      This ethereal orrery lasts until you dismiss it (no action required) or
      move.</p>
