  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You touch a Small or smaller object or container, slowing the passage
      of time by half for that object and its contents. For example, food would
      take twice as long to spoil, or a lamp would burn twice as long on the
      same amount of oil. </p><p>This effect lasts until you cast the spell
      again, the object is destroyed, or 24 hours pass. This does not affect the
      item's interactions with the world (for example, a preserved weapon would
      not swing any slower). </p><p>When you reach 5th level, the spell slows
      time to 1/3 its usual pace. When you reach 11th level, to 1/4 its usual
      pace. When you reach 11th level, to 1/5 its usual pace.</p>
