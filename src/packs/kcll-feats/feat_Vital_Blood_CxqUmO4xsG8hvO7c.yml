  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your mastery of blood magic has given it magical properties, brimming
      with unnatural vitality. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Ability Score Increase. Increase your
      Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of
      20.</p></li><li><p>Bloody Vitality. When you complete a short rest while
      you are bloodied (have less than half your maximum hit points) before
      rolling any hit dice, you regain hit points equal to your spellcasting
      modifier.</p></li><li><p>Crimson Potion. As an action, you can take 1d4
      slashing damage to splatter some of your blood on a willing creature
      within 5 feet, granting them the effects of a Potion of Healing. Once you
      use this ability you cannot use it again until you complete a short or
      long rest.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Crafting System
      Integration</strong></p><p>If using the Kibbles' Crafting System, if you
      have the Vital Blood feat, once per week you can extract some of your
      blood to use it as a Common Curative Reagent in crafting.</p></blockquote>
