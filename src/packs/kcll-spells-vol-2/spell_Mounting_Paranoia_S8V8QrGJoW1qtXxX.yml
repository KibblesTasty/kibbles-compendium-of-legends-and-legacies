  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You shroud the mind of a creature you can see within range in shadow,
      twisting its view of the world. The target perceives everything beyond 15
      feet as wreathed in shadow, indistinct in shape and sound. When the target
      attempts to target a creature wreathed in shadow with an attack or spell,
      it must pass a Wisdom saving throw, or it instead targets a random
      different target within range. When the target becomes able to see a
      creature that was previously wreathed in shadow, it must pass a Wisdom
      saving throw, or become &amp;Reference[frightened] of that creature until
      the start of its next turn.</p><p>At the end of each of the target's
      turns, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the shadows draw 5
      feet closer, closing off the distance the target can see clearly. If the
      targetâ€™s entire vision becomes shrouded in shadow (after its third
      failure), it becomes paralyzed with fear until it succeeds on this save.
      If the target succeeds on this saving throw, the spell ends.</p>
