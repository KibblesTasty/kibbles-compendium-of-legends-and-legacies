  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You point at an empty 5-foot space on the ground you can see within
      range, and a tree sprouts there, rapidly growing to a height of 20 feet
      with a 2-foot radius trunk. The tree must grow on dirt, sand, or another
      appropriate surface. At the DM's discretion, it can burst through up to 6
      inches of hard material. The tree stops growing if it would hit a ceiling
      or other object. </p><p>Any creature in this space must make a Dexterity
      saving throw. On a failure, it is lifted 20 feet into the air in the
      branches of the tree. On a success, it moves 5 feet to an unoccupied space
      of its choice (if there is no empty space to which it can move, it
      automatically fails). A Large or smaller creature can choose to fail this
      save, while a Huge or larger creature automatically succeeds. </p><p>The
      tree provides as half cover to any creature within its branches, and
      three-quarters cover from effects originating on the other side of its
      trunk. The tree has 50 hit points and AC 13. </p><p>The tree remains after
      the spell ends, but may die rapidly if sprouted in an unsuitable location
      or environment. Its wood is flammable only when dried, and serves no
      useful purpose except as firewood.</p>
