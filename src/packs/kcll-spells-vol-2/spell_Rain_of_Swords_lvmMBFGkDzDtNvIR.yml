    value: >-
      <p>A rain of swords begins to fall in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot high
      cylinder centered on a point within range. Any creatures starting its turn
      in the area or entering it for the first time on its turn must make a
      Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a
      success, it takes half as much damage.</p><p>The swords are stuck upright
      in the ground and can be removed and used by anyone within 5 feet of the
      spell's area, functioning as nonmagical longswords. They vanish when the
      spell ends.</p>
