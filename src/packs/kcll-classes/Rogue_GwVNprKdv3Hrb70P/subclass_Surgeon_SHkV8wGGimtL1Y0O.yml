      <p>These are Rogues that come from the bloodiest walk of life... that of a
      medic. Few Rogues have sliced open more creatures than a Surgeon, and they
      leverage their masterful understanding of anatomy to cut open and sew
      close in equal measure. They have seen everything an adventuring life has
      to offer—roper bites, dragon burns, bore holes in skulls—and turned that
      array of knowledge into a complete understanding of what a creature can
      survive... and what it can’t.</p><p>Surgeons will tend to exhibit some
      degree of education, be it academic or hands on. They have seen the best
      and worst of humanity and the battlefield. Sometimes they are selfless
      heroes that act as a bulwark against death, while other times they are
      cynical and jaded to carnage, falling to apathy or worse.</p><hr /><p>The
      following are some optional quirks for a player of this Archetype to
      choose from—these can be either preexisting, signaling their fated path
      toward this Archetype, or appear after they select this
      Archetype.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-tables.RollTable.8vclosQGqHIs6eL5
