    value: >-
      <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to exert the full force of your
      rage, unleashing a devastating attack. As an action while you are raging,
      you can attempt to make a single, massive, weapon attack, dealing normal
      weapon damage + 6d6 bonus damage of the same damage type and knocking the
      target prone on hit. All other creatures besides yourself within 5 feet of
      where you hit the target take 1d6 + your Strength damage bludgeoning
      damage from the shock wave of the impact.</p><p>If this attack is made
      using a creature you are grappling as a weapon (using an improvised weapon
      attack), the grappled creature takes the same 6d6 bonus damage as the
      target on hit, or half as much on a miss.</p>
