    value: >-
      <p>You release a stream of fire from your hands, filling a 30-foot long,
      10-foot wide line with a continual gout of flame. Any creature in the area
      when you cast the spell or entering the area before the start of your next
      turn must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a
      failure or half as much on a success. As an action on your subsequent
      turns for the duration, you can release a new line of fire with the same
      effect.</p><p> At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
      slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot
      level above 3rd.</p>
