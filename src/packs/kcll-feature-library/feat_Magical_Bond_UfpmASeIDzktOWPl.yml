      <p>Starting at 6th level, your Beast Companions count as magical for the
      purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and
      damage.</p><p>Additionally, whenever you expend a spell slot of 3rd level
      or higher on your turn, you beast can take one additional action on its
      turn. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack
      only), Dash, Disengage, or Hide.</p>
