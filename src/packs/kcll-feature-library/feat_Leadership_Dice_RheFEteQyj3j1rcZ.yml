      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you have access to Leadership Dice. These
      represent your ability to focus your battlefield presence for powerful
      results. Your Warlord level determines the number and size of the dice, as
      shown on the Leadership Dice column of the Warlord table. You can spend
      these to fuel various features.</p><p>You know three such features:
      @UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feature-library.Item.ixwODKZSYCBeT5lk]{Rallying
      Mark},
      @UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feature-library.Item.gdbkqOTXMXEB6MR4]{Urgent
      Orders}, and
      @UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feature-library.Item.MhimYINnyNBuv2SA]{Helpful
      Word}. When you get this feature, you can spend one Leadership Die per
      turn. Starting at 6th level, you can spend two Leadership Dice per turn.
      The number you can expend increases to three at 11th level, and to four at
      17th level.</p><p>A Leadership Die is expended when you use it. You regain
      all of your expended Leadership Dice when you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>
