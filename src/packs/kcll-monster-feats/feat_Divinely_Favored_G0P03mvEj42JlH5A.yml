  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A monster favored by its gods or a higher power. This feat is most
      appropriate for a type of monster that has an actively involved god in the
      fate of their species (orcs, goblins, giants, etc.). The creature gains
      the following benefits. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Blessed.</strong> The
      creature adds +1d4 to all attack rolls and saving throws.
      </p></li><li><p><strong>Divine Strike (Recharge 4–6).</strong> As part of
      its Multiattack action (or as an action if it lacks the Multiattack
      action) the monster holds aloft its weapon and calls down divine
      retribution at a point within 60 feet. All creatures within 15 feet of the
      target point must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 8 + CHA
      mod + PB. On a failed save, creatures take PBd8 radiant damage (if the
      creature is good, neutral aligned, or unaligned) or necrotic damage (if
      the creature is evil aligned). On a successful save, they take half as
      much damage. The monster then regains PBd8 hit points.
      </p></li><li><p><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong> +1</p></li></ul>
