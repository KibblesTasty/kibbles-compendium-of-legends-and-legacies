      <p>You create a 5-foot radius illusory pit at a point you can see on the
      ground. Each creature within the area when the spell is cast must succeed
      on a Wisdom saving throw or believe it has fallen into the pit. It falls
      &amp;Reference[prone], cannot stand up, and cannot see beyond the radius
      of the pit.</p><p>A creature can spend its action to attempt to climb out
      of the pit, repeating its saving throw. On a success, it spends all of its
      movement to stand up and then realizes the pit is an illusion, ending the
      spell for it. On a failure, it continues to believe it is stuck in the
      pit. An affected creature can move within the spaces covered by the
      pit.</p><p>A creature with a flying speed automatically succeeds on its
      saving throw. Each time a creature under the effect takes damage, it can
      repeat its saving throw.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you
      cast the spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of
      the pit increases by 5 feet for each level above 1st, to a maximum of a 20
      feet with a 4th-level spell slot</p>
