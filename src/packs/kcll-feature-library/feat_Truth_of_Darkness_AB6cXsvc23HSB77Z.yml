      <p>Darkness is home to those that live in it. Any darkvision or blindsight
      you have is doubled in range, up to a maximum of 120 feet. If you have
      neither, you gain a darkvision of 30 feet, which is doubled by this
      feature to 60 feet. You can see normally in dim light and darkness.</p>
