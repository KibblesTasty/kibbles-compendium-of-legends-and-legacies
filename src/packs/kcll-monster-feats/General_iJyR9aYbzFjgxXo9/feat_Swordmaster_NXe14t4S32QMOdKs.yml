      <p>This monster has mastered the art of a sword to be a menace to any foe
      that it faces with an arsenal of sword tricks. It is most often found on
      intelligent monsters that have trained with the sword, but might be found
      in unexpected places, like a goblin camp. The monster gains the following
      features.</p><ul><li><strong>Deflection.</strong> As a reaction being
      attacked, the monster can add its PB to its
      AC.</li><li><strong>Riposte.</strong> If the creature is attacked by a
      creature within reach, it can use its reaction to make a single weapon
      attack with its sword against the attacker.</li><li><strong>CR
      Adjustment:</strong> +1</li></ul>
