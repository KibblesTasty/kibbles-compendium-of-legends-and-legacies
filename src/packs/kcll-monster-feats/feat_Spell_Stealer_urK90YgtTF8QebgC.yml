      <p>The monster has adapted to high magic environments and gained
      supernatural influence on magic around it. It is most appropriate for
      monsters from exotic locales, elementals, or golems. It gains the
      following feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Spell Stealer (Recharge 6).</strong>
      When the creature is targeted by a spell, or a spell is cast with a target
      point within 30 feet of the creature, the creature can attempt to steal
      control of the spell as a reaction. It makes a Constitution ability check
      (d20 + CON mod + PB) contested by the caster making a Spellcasting ability
      check. On success, the creature steals control of the spell, picking a new
      target for the spell within 30 feet of it. This effect automatically
      recharges if the monster fails to steal the spell.</li><li><strong>CR
      Adjustment:</strong> +1</li></ul>
