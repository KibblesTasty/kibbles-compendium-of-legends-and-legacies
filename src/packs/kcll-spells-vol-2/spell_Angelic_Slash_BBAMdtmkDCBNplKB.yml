    value: >-
      <p>You summon a giant spectral angel that appears around you before
      crashing its greatsword down in a line. All creatures in a line 30 feet
      long and 5 feet wide in a direction of your choice must make a Dexterity
      saving throw. A target takes 5d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half
      as much damage on a successful one. A creature takes an additional 1d8
      damage if it is undead or a fiend.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level
      or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 3rd.</p>
