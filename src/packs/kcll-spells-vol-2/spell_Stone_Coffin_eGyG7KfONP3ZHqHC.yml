    value: >-
      <p>You cause a surge of stone to attempt to encase a Large or smaller
      creature. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it
      becomes trapped in the coffin, causing it to be &amp;Reference[blinded]
      and &amp;Reference[restrained]. A creature can choose to fail their save.
      While trapped within the coffin, a creature has total cover against all
      sources. The coffin has an AC of 15 and 50 hit points, and resistance to
      all damage beside bludgeoning and thunder damage. When the spell ends or
      the coffin is reduced to 0 hit points, it crumbles to fragments and the
      creature within is no longer restrained and blinded.</p><p>For the
      duration of the spell you can use your bonus action to crush a creature
      encased in the coffin, dealing 1d10 bludgeoning damage.</p><p><strong>At
      Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th
      level or higher, the stone coffin gains 10 additional hit points for each
      level above 5th.</p>
