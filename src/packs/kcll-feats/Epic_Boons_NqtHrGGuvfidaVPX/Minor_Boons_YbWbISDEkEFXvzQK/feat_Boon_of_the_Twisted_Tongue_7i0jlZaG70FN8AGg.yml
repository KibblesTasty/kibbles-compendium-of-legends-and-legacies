      <p>Insight checks and spells cannot reveal your deceptions or compel you
      to speak the truth, unless they are performed by an entity of greater
      power than the one that granted you the boon. This does not mean that
      creatures automatically believe you, or that your lies cannot be revealed
      by other means (such as context, logic, or evidence).</p>
