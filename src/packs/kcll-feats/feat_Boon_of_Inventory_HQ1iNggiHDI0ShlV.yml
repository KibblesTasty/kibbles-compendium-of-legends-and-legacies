    value: >-
      <p>You gain a sub-dimensional space allowing you to store up to items in
      space roughly 64 cubic feet. As an action, you can place an item that you
      can carry into this space, or retrieve an item that is already in the
      space. You cannot place living things into this space. The passage of time
      does not affect items stored in this inventory</p>
