      <p>Starting at 18th level, you learn the form of waterK spell. If you
      already know the form of water spell, you can learn one additional spell
      of 6th level or lower from the Sorcerer spell list. This spell does not
      count against your spells known. The spell form of water does not require
      concentration for you, though you can end it early at any time (no action
      required). You can cast it by expending 4 sorcery points in place of a
      spell slot.</p><p>While in the watery form granted by the form of water
      spell, the sorcery point cost of all Metamagic options is reduced by 1 for
      all spells that control or manipulate water or ice.</p>
