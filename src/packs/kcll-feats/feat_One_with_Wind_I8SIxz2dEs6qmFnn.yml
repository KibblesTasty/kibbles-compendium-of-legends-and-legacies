      <p>You have mastered the supernatural ability striking like the wind,
      gaining the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score
      Bonus.</strong> Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom ability score
      by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Wind Walker.</strong> You are
      not affected by difficult terrain or additional movement costs when the
      difficult terrain or movement cost comes from strong winds (such as the
      gust of wind spell).</li><li>You gain the Wind Strike special attack
      (below).</li></ul><h5 id="wind-strike">Wind Strike</h5><p><em>Active
      Ability (Attack, Supernatural)</em></p><p>When you take the Attack action
      on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a special attack
      that lets you vanish into the wind before striking a number of nearby
      creatures with a weapon you are carrying in a flurry of blows, before
      reform from the wind within 5 feet of one of the creatures attacked. You
      can attack a number of creatures in this way equal to your proficiency
      bonus, but can only strike each creature once. You can strike creatures
      within a range of 5 Ã— your proficiency bonus feet (for example when you
      proficiency bonus is +2, you can strike creatures within 10
      feet).</p><p>Each time you strike a creature, make a melee weapon attack,
      dealing 1d6 + your Mystic Path modifier damage on a hit. The damage
      increases by 1d6 each time your proficiency bonus increases.</p><p>Once
      you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short
      or long rest.</p>
