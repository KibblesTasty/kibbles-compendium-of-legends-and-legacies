      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you gain the ability to manifest chains
      within the range of your Primal Interdiction.</p><p>As a reaction to a
      creature attempting to leave your Primal Interdiction or as an attack as
      part of the Attack action, you can manifest a chain and attempt to bind a
      Large or smaller creature with it, making a grapple check against the
      target. On a success, they are grappled by the chain until they escape
      (contesting your grapple check), the chain is destroyed, or they are no
      longer within your primal interdiction.</p><p>The chain can be destroyed.
      It has an AC of 18 and number of hit points equal to your Warden level,
      but73 you take no damage when the chain is destroyed. If a target escapes
      the chains, the chains fall to the ground and turn to dust.</p><p>You can
      manifest one chain at a time. If you manifest an additional chain while
      you already have your maximum number of chains manifested, the first
      created one vanishes, releasing the target. The number of chains you can
      manifest this way increases by one each time you gain an effect that would
      increase the damage die of your Warden natural weapons (such as Evolving
      Power or Savage Weapons). Once you can manifest more than one chain, you
      can target the same creature with multiple chains. A creature is
      restrained while grappled by more than one chain.</p>
