      <p>Two vast armies stand across the field of death, fear gripping the
      heart of every soldier. From their ranks, the banner is carried forth—a
      shining beacon without fear. Before they even know it, their feet pound
      across the ground, their fear left behind as they follow their symbol of
      hope to victory.</p><p>Collapsing to the ground, a man succumbs to wounds,
      exhaustion, terror, and the overwhelming clash of steel all around. Death
      closes in, but before it can claim him, a hand appears, pulling him to his
      feet. “On your feet, soldier”.</p><p>The line will soon be overrun—until,
      among the broken ranks of soldiers, a lone soldier spots his liege. She
      stands, unwilling to turn aside, unwilling to step back from danger,
      holding back the horde of enemies alone. Retreat is no longer an option.
      With newfound strength behind every blow, the soldiers stand and fight
      like no one has ever fought before.</p><p>“How did you do it?” hisses the
      marauder, his sword dropped before him in surrender. He kneels beside his
      captured comrades, encircled by a smaller force that seems to have come
      from nowhere. The victorious general smiles knowingly and shrugs. “Luck,”
      he says. “And perhaps a bit of planning.”</p><p>Warlords are force
      multipliers for their companions. Some may be fearsome combatants, while
      others may never lift a weapon, but in either case their presence on the
      battlefield will drive their allies to new heights, guiding them safely
      through what would surely have been their doom.</p><p>How victory is
      stolen from the jaws of defeat can vary, from inciting crazed zeal, to
      tempering an overeager charge, to pulling their friends out of the line of
      danger in the nick of time. The sole commonality is that a Warlord alone
      is but a man, while a Warlord with their companions is a legend.</p><h2
      id="purpose-and-drive">Purpose and Drive</h2><p>Purpose is a common
      element to those that walk the path of a Warlord. Purpose empowers
      Warlords to be a larger-than-life, and allows them to be a guiding hand to
      their comrades. Some Warlords may not seek any particular cause, and
      merely pursue victory— such as blood, hair, or scales—either as a tribute
      to a god they worship or simply to attain personal glory. More often,
      though, a Warlord is driven by a higher purpose—a loyalty to their country
      or their men, a drive to protect the innocent or crush the weak.</p><h2
      id="power-of-presence">Power of Presence</h2><p>Most warlords have no
      explicitly magical powers, but the presence on the battlefield allows
      people to exceed what they might have thought of as their own limits,
      pushing beyond what they could hope to achieve on their own. A Warlord
      will make their allies feel like they’ve become better at everything, they
      will make problems seem surmountable, and they will make the path clear.
      They make the world less bleak, they make the foes less terrifying. When
      you have a Warlord on your side, more things go right.</p><h2
      id="creating-a-warlord">Creating a Warlord</h2><p>When creating a Warlord
      you should always start with answering the question: what sort of Presence
      does this person bring to the battlefield? Are they a charismatic
      inspiration to their allies that drives them to fight on? Are they a wise
      veteran who acts as a force multiplier for their companions, offering
      pointers and grit? Or are they a scheming manipulator who sees one step
      ahead of any move their foes can make, always making sure their allies are
      in the right spot?</p><h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3><p>You can make
      a warlord quickly by following these suggestions. For a Commander, select
      Strength as your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. For a
      Chieftain or Paragon, select Strength as your highest ability score,
      followed by Charisma. For a Noble, select Charisma as your highest ability
      score, followed by Constitution. For a Packleader, select Dexterity as
      your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. For a Tactician, select
      Intelligence as your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.</p>
