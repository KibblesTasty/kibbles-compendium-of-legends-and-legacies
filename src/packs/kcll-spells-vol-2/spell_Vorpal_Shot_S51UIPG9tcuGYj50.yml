  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You touch a piece of ammunition or a weapon with the thrown property,
      granting it a razor-sharp edge. The first time a creature attacks with the
      empowered item, it adds +3 to its attack and damage rolls, and ignores all
      resistances and immunities to the weapon's damage type. On a hit, the
      creature takes 6d8 additional damage. If this damage reduces the target to
      0 hit points, it receives a mortal wound and immediately dies.</p><p> Once
      an attack has been made with the piece of ammunition or weapon, the spell
      ends.</p>
