    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, when you roll initiative or as a bonus action at
      any time, you can manifest one or both of your hands into draconic talons.
      You cannot wield weapons or shields in hands that you have morphed into
      talons, but they can be used to grapple creatures. While you are grappling
      a creature with a talon, that talon can only attack that creature. The
      talons last until you dismiss them as a bonus
      action.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feature-library.Item.Svf6Wmd4TPFGMZ2q]{Draconic
