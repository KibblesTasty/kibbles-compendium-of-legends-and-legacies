      <p>Your powers are tied to the nature of life and its ever shifting
      balance. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit
      points or grants temporary hit points, you can heal a creature other than
      yourself within 30 feet for a number of hit points equal to your Occultist
      level. Your current hit points are reduced by half as many hit points as
      you restore with this feature.</p><p>You can only use this ability on
      creatures that have vibrant life pulsing within them.</p><p>This
      revelation does not work on undead, constructs, or creatures at zero hit
      points. A spell can only trigger one Revelation. If multiple Revelations
      apply, choose one.</p>
