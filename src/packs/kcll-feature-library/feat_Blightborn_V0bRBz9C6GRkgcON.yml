    value: >-
      <p>Uniquely your animating force is a physical (though still magical)
      phenomena; twisting vines growing through your remains. Your creature type
      is both Plant and Undead, and you can leverage your vines to constrict
      your enemies. You can grapple a number of creatures equal to your
      Constitution modifier without using your hands.</p>
