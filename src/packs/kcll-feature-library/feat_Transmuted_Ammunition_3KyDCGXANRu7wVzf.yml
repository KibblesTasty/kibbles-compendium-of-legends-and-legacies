    value: >-
      <p>Additionally at 7th level, when you infuse a spell that targets a line,
      you can transmute your ammunition into the spell effect, releasing the
      spell in a line from you as if you had cast it, but using your Strength or
      Dexterity modifier (your choice) in place of your Intelligence modifier
      for the spell save DC. When you do this, you add your weapon damage
      (including modifier) to the spell’s damage roll.</p>
