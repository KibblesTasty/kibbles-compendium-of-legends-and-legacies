    value: >-
      <p>You conjure an anvil 500 feet above a point you can see. At initiative
      count 0 (losing ties) on the next round, the anvil hits the ground. Each
      creature within 5 feet of the target point must make a Dexterity saving
      throw. On a success, it moves to the closest unoccupied space outside of
      the radius. If no space is available or a creature cannot move, it
      automatically fails. On a failure, a creature takes 10d10 + 10 bludgeoning
      damage. Creatures within 20 feet of the target point take 4d4 thunder
      damage.</p><p>If the path of the anvil (directly above the target point)
      is interrupted, the creature or object above it is hit first. If the
      creature or object is killed or destroyed, the anvil continues, though the
      damage dealt is subtracted from the final impact damage of the anvil. If
      the anvil deals less than 80 damage, the anvil survives the impact, and is
      an anvil of moderate quality.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong>
      When cast with a 9th-level spell slot, the range of the spell becomes 120
      miles, though you must still be able to see the target (such as via
      scrying).</p>
