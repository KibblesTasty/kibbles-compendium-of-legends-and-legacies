      <p>Starting at 6th level, you can sacrifice your hit points to empower
      your magic. When you expend a Pact Magic spell slot to cast a spell that
      has an effect that scales with spell level, you can expend a number of hit
      points equal 1 + to the level of the spell to increase the level at which
      you cast the spell by one level (for example, if you cast the 2nd level
      spell hold person using a 3rd level Pact Magic Spell slot, you could
      expend 3 hit points to cast it at the 4th level).</p><p>When you cast a
      cantrip, you can scale the cantrip to its next level of power (for
      example, casting it as if you were 11th level) by spending 3 hit points
      this way. This works even when you are 17th level, and the cantrip would
      generally not scale further (adding an additional die or firing an
      additional beam in the case of eldritch blast).</p><p> You can spend a
      total number of hit points this way equal to your Warlock level, after
      which you cannot spend more hit points to empower your spells until you
      complete a long rest.</p>
