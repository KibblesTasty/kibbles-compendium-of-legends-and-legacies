      <p>You master grappling and leverage to pin and fling your foes. You gain
      the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength or Constitution by 1, to a
      maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Quick Grabs.</strong> When you take the
      Attack action on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike or attempt to
      grapple as a bonus action.</li><li>Gain the Martial Toss special attack
      (below).</li></ul><h5 id="martial-toss">Martial Toss</h5><p><em>Active
      Ability (Attack)</em></p><p>When you take the Attack action on your turn,
      you can replace one of your attacks to attempt to hurl a creature of your
      size or smaller. The target must make a Strength saving throw. An object
      or creature you are grappling automatically fails. If you successfully
      lift them, you can throw them 20 feet. The range is increased by 10 feet
      for each size smaller than you the target is.</p><p>The creature’s
      movement ends early if it collides with another creature or obstacle. The
      thrown creature and anything it collides with takes 2d6 + your Strength
      modifier, and the thrown creature falls prone. The number of d6 increases
      by one when your proficiency bonus increases (with the total number of d6
      equaling your proficiency bonus).</p><p>A creature can choose to fail
      their save against this ability. You can throw a willing creature more
      carefully, dealing no damage to them unless they collide with something
      during their flight. </p><p>Once you use this feature to successfully
      throw a creature or object, you cannot use it again until you complete a
      short or long rest.</p>
