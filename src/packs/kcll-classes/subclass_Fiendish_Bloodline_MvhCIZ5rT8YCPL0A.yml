      <p>Your innate magic comes from a bloodline tainted by fiendish influence
      of the lower planes. How directly this blood is inherited varies wildly.
      Perhaps your lineage includes a Warlock that has made some infernal pact,
      or you may even have a fiend in your family tree. Such blood lines can
      express themselves more strongly throughout generations in unpredictable
      ways. Sometimes it is merely the product of some sort of corruption,
      perhaps before you were even born.</p><p>The influence is most often seen
      in races that have obvious fiendish heritage, such as tieflings, but it is
      not inherently tied to them.</p><h5>Optional: Fiendish Trait</h5><p>You
      can optionally select to have a physical fiendish trait. Roll or select an
      option from the table
      below:</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-tables.RollTable.rgScemEAdnsYv9SP
