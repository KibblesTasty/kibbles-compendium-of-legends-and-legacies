    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, the doggo has advantage on an attack roll
      against a creature if at least one of the doggo’s allies is within 5 feet
      of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated. If the doggo already had
      pack tactics, its pack tactics improve and whenever it has advantage on an
      attack roll from pack tactics, it can reroll one of the dice once.</p><p>
      Additionally, the doggo can pass through the space of allied creatures
      without expending additional movement.</p>
