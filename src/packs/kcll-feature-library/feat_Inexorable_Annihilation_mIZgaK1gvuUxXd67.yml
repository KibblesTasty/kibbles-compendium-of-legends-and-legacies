  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Creatures that fail a saving throw against your 1st level or higher
      Occultist spells that deal damage gain lingering cracks in their form
      which slowly erode them. They take 1d6 force damage at the end of each
      their turns. This ends after dealing damage if the creature is more than
      120 feet from you, you cannot see the creature, or you are
      incapacitated.</p>
