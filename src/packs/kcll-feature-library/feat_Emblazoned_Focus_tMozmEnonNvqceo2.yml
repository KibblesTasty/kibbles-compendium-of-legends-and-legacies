    value: >-
      <p>You emblazon a mystical mark on yourself via a tattoo, scar, or similar
      permanent mark. You can use this mark as your spellcasting focus for your
      Occultist spells. You no longer need a free hand to cast spells with
      somatic or material components, as you can channel your magic through the
      mark, though it glows visibly when you do so. The mark must remain
      uncovered to function as a spellcasting focus (casting in this way does
      not remove the signs of casting a spell, it merely means you do not need a
      free hand).</p>
