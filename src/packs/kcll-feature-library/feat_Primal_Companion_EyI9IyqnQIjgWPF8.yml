      <p>Starting at 2nd level when you join this circle, you form a bond with a
      beast spirit and can allow it to take form by expending a use of your Wild
      Shape as an action. Its statblock becomes that of your Beast Companion,
      applying the modifications from the customization table that best fit the
      form it takes. At the GM’s discretion, custom abilities can replace those
      powers to better represent the beast companion. Once selected, the traits
      cannot be changed, as the beast’s spirit takes on that form
      permanently.</p><p>The beast’s soul becomes entangled with your own,
      granting you the ability to call it forth from wherever it is, and even
      return it to life should it ever fall, by expending a use of your Wild
      Shape ability. As an action you can expend a use of Wild Shape to call it
      to an empty space within 10 feet of you, where it appears at full hit
      points and free of any conditions or spells that were affecting it. You
      can cause it to return to its spirit form as a bonus action, but must
      expend a use of Wild Shape to call it forth once more after doing
      so.</p><p>In combat, the Beast Companion shares your initiative count, but
      it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its
      turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to
      command it to take another action. You can command your Beast Companion as
      part of the same bonus action used to summon it. That action can be the
      one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the
      Beast Companion can take any action of its choice, not just
      Dodge.</p><p>When you manifest the companion, it lasts until you complete
      a long rest (unless you expend a use of Wild Shape to keep it manifested
      until a subsequent long rest), it is reduced to zero hit points, or you
      die, at which point it vanishes, fading away until you expend a use of
      Wild Shape to call it forth again.</p><blockquote><h3>Spirit
      Animal</h3><p>At your GM's discretion, you can form a bond with a normal
      willing animal, its statblock getting replaced with the Beast Companion
      statblock, with customizations selected to best represent its original
      stats. It gains all the same properties as a Primal Companion, it's soul
      becoming entangled with your own, and it becomes a spirit
      beast.</p><h3>Form Permanency</h3><p>This rule is to prevent having to
      rebuild the stat block and save time, as well as a balance consideration,
      but at the GM's discretion they can allow it to be changed to a new
      permanent form if there is a good reason.</p></blockquote>
