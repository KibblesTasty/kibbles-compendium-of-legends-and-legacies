      <p>Starting at 10th level, you can hear a whisper on the winds that tells
      you where they go and what they do. You can predict the weather accurately
      up to 8 hours away, and know if any weather effect is natural or magical
      in nature.</p><p>Additionally, you may hear other things on the winds by
      way of what they hear; you can cast
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{scrying} without
      expending a spell slot or requiring any verbal or material components, but
      when cast in this way, your sensor can only hear and not see. A target
      gets a −5 penalty to the save if they are in a place open to the wind
      (such as outdoors), or a +5 bonus to the save if they are in a place that
      the wind cannot reach (such as caves or indoors).</p><p>Once you cast
      scrying in this way, you cannot cast it again until you complete a long
      rest.</p>
