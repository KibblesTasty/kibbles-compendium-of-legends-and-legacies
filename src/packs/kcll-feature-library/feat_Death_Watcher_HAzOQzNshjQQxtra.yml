      <p><em>Prerequisite: 12th level Occultist</em></p><p>You can see the lines
      of fate, and detect when one of them is about to snap. When an ally that
      can see or hear you would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking
      damage, as a reaction you can manipulate their fate with a cryptic
      warning, causing them to narrowly avoid their demise, instead dropping to
      1 hit point. </p><p>Once you use this Rite, you must finish a long rest
      before you can use it again.</p>
