    value: >-
      <p>You point at a creature and attempt to make its heart explode in a
      violent spasm. If the target has fewer than 20 hit points, its heart
      explodes and it immediately dies. If it has more than 20 hit points, it
      must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 10d6
      necrotic damage and is &amp;Reference[stunned] until the start of your
      next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage and is not stunned.
      If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it
      dies.</p><p>Creatures without a heart are immune to this spell, though at
      your DM’s discretion similar organs or components (for example, a golem’s
      magic core) may qualify as a heart.</p>
