  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a ritual taking 1 hour, you can absorb the power from a magical
      weapon with a bonus to attack and damage rolls. This cannot target
      artifacts, sentient weapons, or cursed items. At your DM’s discretion,
      this might not work with other weapons depending on their origin and type.
      This drains the power from the weapon, leaving it as a mundane weapon, but
      your Aethersword gains the bonus to attack and damage rolls previously
      possessed by the magical weapon.</p>
