      <p>Starting at 7th level, you can find small breaks in the flow of battle
      to drink potions. You can drink any potion that would normally require an
      action as a bonus action. </p><p>Additionally, you can attempt to cast
      spell scrolls that would normally be unintelligible to you. When doing so,
      you automatically succeed if the DC of the required spellcasting check is
      less than 10 + your proficiency bonus, otherwise you roll 1d20 + your
      proficiency bonus in place of making a spellcasting check, unless your
      spellcasting check would be higher</p>
