      <p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the
      ability to cast spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of
      spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the cleric spell
      list.</p><h5><strong>Cantrips</strong></h5><p>You learn two cantrips of
      your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric
      cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p><h5><strong>Spell
      Slots</strong></h5><p>The Crusader Spellcasting table shows how many spell
      slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast
      one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or
      higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long
      rest.</p><h5><strong>Spells Known of 1st-Level and
      Higher</strong></h5><p>You know three 1st-level cleric spells of your
      choice from the cleric spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the
      Crusader Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st
      level or higher.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can
      replace one of the cleric spells you know with another spell of your
      choice from the cleric spell list.</p><h5><strong>Spellcasting
      Ability</strong></h5><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your
      cleric spells, since you learn your spells through faith and conviction.
      You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
      In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC
      for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
      one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
      your Wisdom modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your
      proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
