      <p>A wave of water sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone
      must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/r
      2d6]] bludgeoning damage and is knocked 10 feet away from you. If a
      creature is knocked into a wall, another creature, or fails by 5 or more,
      it is additionally knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes
      half as much damage and is not knocked back. If there is a source of water
      of at least 5 cubic feet within 5 feet of you when you cast the spell, you
      can displace that water, increasing the range of the spell to a 25 foot
      cone.</p>

      <p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell
      using a spell lot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by [[/r
      1d6]] for each level above 1st.</p>
