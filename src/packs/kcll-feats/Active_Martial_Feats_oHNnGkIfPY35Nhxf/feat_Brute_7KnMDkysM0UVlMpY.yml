      <p>Your attacks leave your enemies devastated and cowering in fear. You
      gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a
      maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Brutal Effort.</strong> When you roll
      damage for a melee weapon attack, you can reroll the weaponâ€™s damage dice
      and use either total.</li><li><p>Gain the Brutal Threat special attack
      (below)</p></li></ul><h5 id="brutal-threat">Brutal
      Threat</h5><p><em>Active Ability (Attack)</em></p><p>When you take the
      Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks to issue a
      dire threat backed by your killing intent at a creature that can see or
      hear you within 60 feet. The target must make a Wisdom saving
      throw.</p><p>On failure, they become &amp;Reference[frightened] for 1
      minute. If it fails by 5 or more, it becomes frozen in terror, suffering
      the &amp;Reference[paralyzed] condition while it is frightened. A
      frightened creature can repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its
      turns, ending the effect on success (if it fails by less than 5 it can end
      the paralyze effect, but cannot become paralyzed after the initial
      save).</p><p>If you kill a target while it is frightened in this way, you
      can repeat this action as a reaction targeting another creature within 30
      feet that can see or hear you bypassing the usual usage restriction of the
      feature.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until
      you complete a short or long rest.</p>
