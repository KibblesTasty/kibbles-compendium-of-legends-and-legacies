      <p>Your mastery with a flail allows you to use the challenging weapon with
      deadly skill. You gain the following benefits while wielding a
      flail:</p><ul><li><strong>Dangerous Swings.</strong> When you miss a melee
      weapon attack made with a flail, you can make a new attack roll against
      another creature you of your choice within the weaponâ€™s range. You cannot
      attack the same creature twice this way.</li><li><strong>Wind Up.</strong>
      As a bonus action, you can whirl the flail building momentum. The next
      attack you make with it before the end of your turns an additional 1d8
      damage on hit.</li></ul>
