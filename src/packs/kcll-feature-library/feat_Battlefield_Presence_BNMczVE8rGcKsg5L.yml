    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, when you take the Attack action, in place of
      making an attack, you can use your Battlefield Presence to grant a
      friendly creature that can see or hear you an additional attack the next
      time they take the Attack action during their turn. </p><p>Any additional
      attacks granted that are unused at the start of your next turn are lost. A
      friendly creature can only gain one additional attack from this feature
      per round from this feature.</p>
