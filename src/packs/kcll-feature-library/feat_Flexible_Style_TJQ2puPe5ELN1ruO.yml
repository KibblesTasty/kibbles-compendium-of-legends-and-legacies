      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you can apply the benefit of any fighting
      style to any weapon attack (including unarmed strikes and improvised
      weapons). If you have multiple Fighting Styles you may pick which the
      attack benefits from. Additionally, at the end of a long rest, you can
      change your Fighting Style selection.</p>
