    value: >-
      <p>When you deal poison damage with an Occultist spell or created poison,
      you can (but don’t have to) specify a creature type (such as beast or
      monstrosity) it is created to affect. Damage from that spell or poison
      ignores resistance and immunity to poison damage by creatures of that
      type. Creatures without the selected creature type have resistance to
      poison damage from the spell effect or poison.</p>
