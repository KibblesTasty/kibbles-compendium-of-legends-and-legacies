      <p>Starting at 2nd level, the steed can pass through tight gaps with
      adroit agility and does not need additional movement to move through
      spaces it has to squeeze through, though if it ends its turn in a spot too
      small for it, it still considered squeezing.</p><p>Additionally, the
      steeds movement speed increases by 5 feet. It increases by 5 additional
      feet at 9th, 13th, and 17th level, as shown on the class
      table.</p><section id="secret-DGsdeV5RLbvDpDyb"

      provides an active effect that increases movement speed by 5 feet. It must
      be manually adjusted at higher levels.</p></section>
