      20.</li><li><strong>Raining Death.</strong> If you kill a creature within
      a single ranged weapon attack (reducing it from maximum hit points to 0
      hit points) using the Attack action on your turn, you can make one
      additional ranged weapon attack as a bonus action that turn.</li><li>Gain

      Storm</h5><p><em>Active Ability (Attack)</em></p><p>When you take the
      Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks by firing
      innumerable pieces of ammunition into the sky which rain down around a
      point within 60 feet of you. All creatures within 10 feet of the point
      must make a Dexterity saving throw. On failure, they take 2d6 + your
      Dexterity modifier damage, or half as much on success. The number of d6
      increases by one when your proficiency bonus increases (with the total
      number of d6 equaling your proficiency bonus). A number of pieces of
      ammunition are consumed equal to the number of targets that make the save
      against the ability times two.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot
      use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
