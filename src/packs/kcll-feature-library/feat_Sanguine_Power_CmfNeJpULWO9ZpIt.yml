    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 6th level, when you deal piercing or slashing damage to a
      creature that has blood, the next time you cast a spell with the Blood
      Magic tag before the end of your next turn, you can reduce the amount of
      your own hit points you need to expend by the piercing or slashing damage
      you dealt to that creature with that attack (you can pick the highest
      damage piercing or slashing damage attack you made during that time).</p>
