    value: >-
      <p>You touch a piece of ammunition or a weapon with the thrown property,
      conjuring a shadowy duplicate superimposed over it until the end of your
      next turn. The first time you attack with the empowered item before the
      end of your next turn, select a second target within the attack's range
      and make a separate ranged weapon attack. On a hit, the target is struck
      by the duplicate item and takes 2d8 force damage. This damage roll does
      not add any modifiers or bonus associated to weapon attacks.</p><p>Once an
      attack has been made with the piece of ammunition or weapon, the spell
      ends.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 2nd Level or higher, you can select one additional
      target for each slot level above 1st.</p>
