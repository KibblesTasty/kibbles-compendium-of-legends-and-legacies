      <p>At 1st level, as a bonus action you can briefly completely assume a
      form akin to your patron. Until the start of your next turn, your body and
      every object you are wearing and carrying becomes elastic and amorphous,
      allowing you to pass through gaps as narrow as one inch and granting
      immunity to the grappled and restrained conditions (freeing you if you are
      currently affected by them).</p><p>Once you do this, you cannot do so
      again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
