      <p>Starting at 18th level, you can pick five additional spells from the
      Druid spell list of 4th level or lower. You can cast these spells using
      Leadership Dice equal to the level of the spell. You can change the list
      of spells you have selected when you complete a long rest.</p>

      <p>The spell Save DC for these spells is 8 + your Proficiency modifier +
      your Wisdom Modifier.</p>

      <p>Any time you use Leadership Dice to cast a spell, you can take the
      Attack action (one weapon attack only) as a bonus action.</p>
