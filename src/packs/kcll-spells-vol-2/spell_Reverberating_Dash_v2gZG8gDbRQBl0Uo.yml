    value: >-
      <p>You imbue a resonating note of magic into a melee weapon you are
      holding. When you do so, you can immediately make one attack against a
      creature within 5 feet with the weapon used in the spell's casting. If the
      attack hits, the note reverberates and deals an additional 1d8 thunder
      damage, and you can immediately move up to 15 feet in a straight line in
      any direction without provoking opportunity attacks. </p><p>If this
      movement leaves you within 5 feet of a creature you have not hit as part
      of this spell, you can immediately make another attack against this
      creature with the weapon used in the spell's casting. If the attack hits,
      the note reverberates even louder and deals an additional 2d8 thunder
      damage, and you can move repeat the movement and attack again. Each time
      you dash, the note grows louder, increasing its thunder damage by 1d8. You
      can move a maximum of 2 times after the initial attack (making up to 3
      attacks in total). You can move again and potentially attack until you
      miss or there is no longer an eligible target you can reach. Each time you
      dash this way, the volume and tempo of the note increases, increasing the
      thunder damage dealt by 1d8. </p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong>
      When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the
      initial thunder damage increases by 1d8, and you can move-and-attack 1
      additional time for each slot level above 2nd, up to a maximum of 5 dashes
      (6 attacks) with a 5th-level spell slot.</p>
