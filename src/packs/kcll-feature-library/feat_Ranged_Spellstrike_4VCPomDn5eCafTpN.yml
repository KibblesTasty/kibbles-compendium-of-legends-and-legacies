    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level when you select this archetype, you gain the
      ability to apply your Spellstrike to pieces of ammunition as well as melee
      weapons, and can trigger the spell strike on a ranged weapon attack made
      with the infused piece of ammunition.</p><p>Spells infused into a ranged
      weapon affect the target of the ranged weapon when fired, but only have a
      range equal to the range of the spell or the normal range of the weapon
      (whichever is shorter range). If you attack a target beyond that range,
      the spell fails and is lost. For spells that create a cone or line area,
      the effect originates from you as normal.</p>
