    value: >-
      <p><em>Incompatible with Improved Pact Weapon</em></p><p>As an action, you
      can grow draconic claws on one or both hands, lasting until you dismiss
      them as an action.</p><p>This claws count as your pact weapon. While the
      claws are formed, you cannot use a weapon or shield in the hand they are
      manifested in. These are natural weapons that deal 1d6 slashing damage.
      When you form claws in both hands, if you make an attack with your claws,
      you can make one additional weapon attack with them as a bonus action.
      When you attack with your claws, you can use your Charisma modifier,
      instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage
      rolls.</p><p>In addition, the claws gain a +1 bonus to its attack and
      damage rolls. These benefits (Charisma, attack and damage bonus, and
      counting the natural weapons as your pact weapon) also applies to any
      natural weapons you gain through the Dragon Subclass (such as Dragon
      Form). You can sacrifice a martial weapon with a bonus greater than +1 to
      attack and damage rolls to your patron, permanently destroying it. When
      you do so, the bonus to attack and damage rolls of your claws increases to
      that of the sacrificed weapon. Your DM has the final say of which weapons
      can be sacrificed in this way, and if any other properties are gained from
      the ritual.</p>
