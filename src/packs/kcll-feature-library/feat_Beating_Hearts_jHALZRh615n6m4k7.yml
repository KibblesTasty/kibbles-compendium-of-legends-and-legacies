    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, you can sense the beating hearts of life in
      creatures around you. You can use your spellcasting modifier, instead of
      your Wisdom modifier, for making Perception and Insight checks against
      living creatures with blood, and to calculate your passive scores to sense
      living creatures.</p><p> You can heighten this sense further by casting
      sense blood without expending a spell slot or material components, but
      once you do so, you cannot do so this way again until you complete a long
      rest.</p>
