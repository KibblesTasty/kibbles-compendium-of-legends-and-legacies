    value: >-
      <p>The monster has grown a highly effective hunting appendage used for
      reeling in prey. Most of this takes the form of a tentacle, tongue, or
      similar feature. This is most often found on monsters like oozes,
      shambling mounds, or other monsters that are normally slow and may have
      evolved a solution to their problems. It gains the following
      feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Tendril Grab.</strong> As a bonus action, the
      creature can shoot out a grabbing appendage toward a target within 20 feet
      of it. The target must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target’s
      choice) against a DC of 8 + STR mod + PB, or be pulled to within 5 feet of
      the creature and &amp;Reference[grappled] (escape DC 10 + STR mod). It can
      grapple one target at a time this way.</li><li><strong>CR
