      <p>Starting at 1st level, you select the Coven you belong to, selecting
      from Black Coven, White Coven, or Green Coven. Based on which Coven you
      select, you gain access to additional spells and manifest different
      special powers. Spells gained from this feature added to your spells known
      and are Occultist spells for you, but do not count against the number of
      spells you can know.</p><p>While the Covens are often associated with
      Evil, Good, and Neutral respectively, you do not have to have a particular
      alignment to join a particular coven - it is merely your area of expertise
      and what traditions you know.</p><p>A Witch of the Black Coven specializes
      in inflicting pain, curses, and eventual agonizing death to those that
      cross her, a Witch of the White Coven focuses on binding and healing, and
      the focus of a Witch of the Green coven is the closest to the Witch's
      roots in Hag-like fey magic, drawing power from nature to baffle her foes
      and control her surroundings.</p>
