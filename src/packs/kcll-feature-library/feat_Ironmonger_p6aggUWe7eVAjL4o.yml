    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level your gain proficiency in heavy armor and martial
      melee weapons. Your Mystical Bulwark functions even when using heavy
      armor, though if you gain additional sources of passive damage reduction,
      additional sources beyond the highest value only increase the damage
      reduction by one for each additional source of passive damage
      reduction.</p>
