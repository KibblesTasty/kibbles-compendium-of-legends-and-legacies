    value: >-
      <p>For the duration you unleash a freezing aura. Any creature starting its
      turn within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
      failure, it takes 2d8 cold damage and its speed is reduced to 0 until the
      start of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage
      and its speed halved. </p><p>As a bonus action on each of your turns for
      the duration, you can actively control the aura, excluding a number of
      creatures in the area up to your spellcasting modifier from the effects
      until the end of your next turn. </p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong>
      When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the
      damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
