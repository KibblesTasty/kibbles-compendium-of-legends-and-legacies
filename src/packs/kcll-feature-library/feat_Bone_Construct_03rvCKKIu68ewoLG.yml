      <p>Starting at 1st level, as an action you can call forth a grim construct
      of bones that bursts from the ground in an empty space within 10 feet of
      you. It has the following stat block. It shares your turn, but cannot take
      any actions unless you use your action to direct it to take the Dodge
      action, Dash action, or take an action listed in its stat block. In
      addition to the actions in a stat block, it can follow simple instructions
      and perform simple tasks out of combat, but cannot communicate or execute
      complicated directions on its own. If you give it no directions, it stands
      still or follows you if you are more than 30 feet from it. When you gain
      the Extra Attack feature, you can replace one attack you can make with
      directing your Bone Construct to take an action.</p><p>Its Strength
      (indicated in its stat block as a *) is equal to your Strength or Wisdom
      ability score (your choice).</p><section id="secret-WT1m2mcLQMXUGAVp"
      class="secret"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>The included "Bone
      Construct" effect will perform the strength adjustment, but the correct
      value must be manually adjusted as your warden's strength and wisdom
      scores change.</p></section><p>If it is more than 120 feet from you or
      reduced to zero hit points, it crumbles to dust. You can dismiss your
      Construct at any time as a bonus action, causing crumble to dust and await
      your call again.</p><p>Your Bone Constructâ€™s hit points are maintained
      between summons, but if it has less than your Warden level in hit points
      (such as if it was previously destroyed by being reduced to 0 hit points),
      it gains hit points equal to your Warden level when you spend your action
      calling it, and regains all of its hit points when you complete a long
      rest.</p><p>Your Bone Constructs Slam damage die is increased in size by
      any effect that increases the size of your natural weapon damage
      dice.</p><p></p>
