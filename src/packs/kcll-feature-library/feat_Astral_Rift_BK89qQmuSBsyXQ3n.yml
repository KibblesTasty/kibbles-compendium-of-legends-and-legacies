      <p>Starting at 14th level, as an action, you can open an Astral Rift
      connecting two places with a tear in reality. One rift appears in an empty
      space within 5 feet of you of your choice, and the other appears in an
      empty space at a point you are familiar with within a number of miles
      equal to your Warden level. The tear takes the shape of a swirling opaque
      roughly circular portal with a 5 foot radius. A willing creature that
      passes through it is teleported to an empty space within 5 feet of the
      other portal</p><p> The rift remains open for 1 minute once opened, or
      until you close it as an action. Once you create an astral rift, you
      cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.</p>
