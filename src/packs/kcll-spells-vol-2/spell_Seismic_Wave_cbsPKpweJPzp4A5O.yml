  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You slam the ground in front of you and cause the earth to explode
      violently in a 30-foot cone. Each creature on the ground in the area must
      make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 4d10 bludgeoning
      damage and falls &amp;Reference[prone]. On a success, it takes half as
      much damage and does not fall prone. Large or larger objects and
      structures in the area automatically fail the save and take double damage.
      The ground becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square
      requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level
      or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
