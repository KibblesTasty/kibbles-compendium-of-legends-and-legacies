    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 7th level, when you make an attack that is a critical
      strike or that kills a creature that is CR 1/4 or higher, you regain one
      use of Arcane Surge.</p><p> If you are bloodied (meaning your current hit
      points are less than half of your maximum hit points) when you trigger
      this ability, you additionally regain hit points equal to your proficiency
      bonus.</p>
