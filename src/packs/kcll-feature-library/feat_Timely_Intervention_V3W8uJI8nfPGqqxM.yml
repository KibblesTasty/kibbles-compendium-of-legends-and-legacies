      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you can expend Endurance Dice to further
      bend time within your Primal Interdiction, gaining the following new
      options for using them:</p><ul><li><strong>Missed Beat:</strong> As a
      reaction to a creature within your Primal Interdiction being attacked, you
      can expend an Endurance Die to slow the creature's reactions, giving the
      triggering attack against them advantage.</li><li><strong>Minor
      Adjustment:</strong> As a reaction to a creature within your Primal
      Interdiction being affected by an area of effect, you stop time long
      enough for them to move up to 5 feet before the effect applies,
      potentially moving out of the area of effect.</li><li><strong>Arrow
      Time:</strong> As a reaction to a creature within your Primal Interdiction
      being attacked by a ranged weapon projectile attack, you can stop the
      projectile in time, rolling the Endurance Die and subtracting the roll
      from the weaponâ€™s attack roll.</li></ul>
