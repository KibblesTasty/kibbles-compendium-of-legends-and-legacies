    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 7th level, when you spend 2 or more Leadership Dice on a
      target with Urgent Orders, you can allow the target creature to make a
      single weapon attack with their reaction instead of moving. If you spend 3
      or more Leadership Dice on a target, the target creature can both move and
      make a single weapon attack with their reaction.</p>
