      <p>The power of water is the strength of flexibility, resilience, and a
      relentless nature. Water parts to allow a ship to sail over it or a diver
      to plunge into it, but their passing leaves no mark. Water flowing down a
      mountain reaches the sea. It might bend and turn across valleys and down
      hillsides, but it slowly and steadily returns to the waves. Those whose
      souls are touched by the power of elemental water command a similar
      power.</p><p>Your heritage ties back to powerful creatures of the sea,
      such as nereids, the lords of the merfolk, or elemental powers. Like a
      river, you feel the call of the ocean. The call is ever present in your
      heart, and you are never completely at peace until you are near the
      sea.</p><hr /><p>The following are some optional quirks for a player of
      this Bloodline to choose
      from.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-tables.RollTable.9VRYyTKswc7TbsVk
