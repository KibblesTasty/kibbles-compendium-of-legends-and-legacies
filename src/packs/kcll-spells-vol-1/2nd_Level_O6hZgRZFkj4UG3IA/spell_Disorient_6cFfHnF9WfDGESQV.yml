      reality. The target creature must pass a Wisdom saving throw or become
      disoriented. A disoriented creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls
      and at the start of their turn moves 10 feet (up to its speed) in a random
      direction before their speed becomes zero until the start of their next
      turn.</p><p>At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another
      Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends, but if the target fails
      by 5 or more, it fails &amp;Reference[prone].</p>
