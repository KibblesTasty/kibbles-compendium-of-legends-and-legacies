    value: >-
      <p>You invoke a curse on a creature’s bloodline. Up to 5 creatures of your
      choice (other than the target) of the same creature type within range are
      bound to that creature by a magical curse. If a creature is directly
      related (ancestor, descendant, or sibling) to the target creature, the
      range at which they can be cursed with this bond increases to 1
      mile.</p><p>When that creature becomes bloodied (reduced to less than half
      its maximum hit points) and again if that creature dies, all creatures
      effected by the curse must make a Charisma saving throw, taking 5d6 +
      twice the cursed creature’s CR (or level) necrotic damage on failed save,
      or half as much on success. This curse has no effect on creatures without
      blood.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      with a 6th level slot or higher, the number of creatures you can target
      increases by 1 for each level above 5th. When using a 9th-level spell
      slot, the range at which you can target a related creature can be
      unlimited, though you must be aware of the target’s existence.<br /></p>
