    value: >-
      <p>You open a pit to hell beneath the feet of your foes. A supernatural
      void opens in a 10-foot radius, 10-foot deep pit opens around a point you
      can see within range.</p><p>Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity
      saving throw. On success, they can move 5 feet outside the radius of the
      spell. If they cannot move 5 feet out of the radius of the spell (such as
      having no path or insufficient movement speed), they automatically fail
      the saving throw. Creatures that fall their saving throw fall to the
      bottom of the pit (taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage and falling
      &amp;Reference[prone]). The floor of the pit is a blazing inferno of hell.
      Creatures that start their turn in the pit take 4d6 fire damage and 4d6
      necrotic damage.</p><p>The pit is difficult to escape, voraciously drawing
      creatures caught in to the depths of hell with strong winds, roaring
      fires, and infernal chains. A creature can spend 20 feet of movement (or
      10 if they a flying or climbing speed) to attempt to escape the pit,
      making a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On success,
      they escape. On failure, fall back to the floor of the pit and their
      movement speed becomes 0 until the start of their next turn.</p><p>When
      the spell ends, the supernatural void to hell closes, and all creatures in
      the pit are deposited on the ground where the pit opened prone.</p>
