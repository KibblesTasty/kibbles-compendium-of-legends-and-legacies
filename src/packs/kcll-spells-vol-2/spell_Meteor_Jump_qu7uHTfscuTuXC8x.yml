    value: >-
      <p>You drastically reduce your weight and immediately &amp;Reference[long
      jump]{jump} up to triple your maximum jump distance without spending any
      movement. When you reach the jump's maximum height, your weight and
      density are instantly increased, causing you to crash down with great
      force.</p><p>Every creature within 10 feet of where you land must make a
      Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 2d10 bludgeoning
      damage and is knocked &amp;Reference[prone]. On a success, it takes half
      as much damage and is not knocked prone. You take no falling damage if the
      fall was less than 100 feet.</p><p>If you land directly on top of another
      creature that is no more than two sizes larger than you, it has
      disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell and is pushed to an
      adjacent empty space of your choice (regardless of its save result).</p>
