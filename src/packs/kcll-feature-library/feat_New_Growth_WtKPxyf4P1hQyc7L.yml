      <p>Starting at 17th level, as an action, you can cause a tree to sprout
      from the ground at a point within 30 feet of you that morphs into a
      tree-like-clone of you. It copies all of your statistics and abilities,
      besides any that recharge on long rest (such as this one) which it does
      not have access to, and is under your control, but has its own actions and
      acts immediately after you in initiative.</p><p>It has hit points equal to
      half your maximum hit points. It is in your Primeval Guardian form, and
      cannot end the effect of that ability. It lasts for 1 minute, or until it
      is reduced to 0 hit points. If you die while it exists, you become the
      clone, after which you can end the Primeval Guardian as normal.</p><p>Once
      you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long
      rest.</p>
