      <p>At 1st level, your connection to waves and waters lets you bend them to
      your will. You learn the manipulate water cantrip, and it does not count
      against your spells known.</p><p>Additionally, when you cast a water or
      cold spell (a spell that controls water, deals water based bludgeoning
      damage, or deals cold damage) that affects other creatures that you can
      see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The
      chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the
      spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on
      a successful save.</p>
