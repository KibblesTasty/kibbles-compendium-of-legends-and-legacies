      <p>You delve deeper into your tradition perfecting a new rite. You can
      select an Occult Rite from the Occultist class Occult Rite list. You
      cannot select a rite you already know, or one that requires a level
      restriction, even if you are already of that level. You can only select
      one from a subclass list if you have at least one level in that
      subclass.</p>
