      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, divine devotion grants you the ability to
      use certain divine magic.</p><h5 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h5><p>The
      Divine Hand table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
      of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
      slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
      when you finish a long rest.</p><h5
      id="spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher">Spells Known of 1st-Level and
      Higher</h5><p>You learn three spells of your choice from the cleric spell
      list. You gain additional spells known as listed on the Spells Known
      column of the cleric spell casting table. Whenever you gain a level in
      this class, you can replace one of your spells you know with another spell
      of your choice from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a
      level for which you have spell slots.</p><h5
      id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Your spell casting
      ability is Wisdom. The power of your spells comes from the depth of your
      faith. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
      ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving
      throw DC for spells you can cast, and when you make an attack roll with
      one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
      your Wisdom modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your
      proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
