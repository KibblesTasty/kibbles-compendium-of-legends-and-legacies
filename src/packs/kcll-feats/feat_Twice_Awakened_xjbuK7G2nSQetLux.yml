    value: >-
      <p>You've mastered a second power of Awakening, gaining control of a
      greater set of powers over your condition. This can be from infusing
      yourself with energy of that source, or simply learning to imitate the
      powers natural to that source (for example, a returned spirit may find
      themselves mastering the powers of a Wandering Spirit after getting used
      to the condition). You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase
      your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ability score by 1, to a maximum of
      20.</li><li><strong>Secondary Force.</strong> Select an additional option
      from the Animating Force table, gaining its features.</li></ul>
