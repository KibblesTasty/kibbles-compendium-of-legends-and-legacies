      <p>You bring ruin to the battlefield, cleaving through hordes. You gain
      the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a
      maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Cleaving Blows.</strong> When you reduce a
      creature to 0 hit points with an attack, you can apply any overflow damage
      (damage dealt by the attack over what was required to bring the target to
      zero) to another creature within 5 feet of the target, if the attack roll
      would also hit that target.</li><li>Gain the Whirlwind Slash special
      attack (below).</li></ul><h5 id="whirlwind-slash">Whirlwind
      Slash</h5><p><em>Active Ability (Attack)</em></p><p>When you take the
      Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with
      spinning your weapon in a massive arc with great force. All creatures of
      your choice within 5 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On
      failure, they take 2d6 + your Strength modifier damage, or half as much on
      a successful save. The number of d6 increases by one when your proficiency
      bonus increases (with the total number of d6 equaling your proficiency
      bonus).</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you
      complete a short or long rest.</p>
