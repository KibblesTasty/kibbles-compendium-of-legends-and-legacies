  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, your ability to see and influence the future
      allows you to set things up to have even greater influence throughout the
      sequence of events, building up to a pivotal moment where exerting your
      foresight can provide the greatest impact.</p><p>Once per turn when you
      use Seeing empowered by 1 or psi points to look into the future while in
      initiative (or under a similar high stakes situation), you gain an
      Influence point. You can have a maximum number of Influence points equal
      to your Intelligence modifier.</p><p>When you start your turn with one or
      more Influence points, you can expend all of your Influence points as psi
      points to empower a psionic power. Influence points spent this way can
      exceed your psi point limit, but cannot be combined with psi
      points.</p><p>Any generated Influence Points are lost after 1 minute, or
      when no longer in combat (or a similar high stakes
      situation).</p><blockquote><p><strong>Conditions of
      Influence</strong></p><p>You can only build up Influence points while in
      combat or other tense situations while every action counts as they
      represent chaining together events toward creating an opportunity. Without
      the pressure and stakes of combat or similar environments, the flow of
      events cannot be manipulated in such a way. This generally means you
      cannot build up Influence points before combat.</p></blockquote>
