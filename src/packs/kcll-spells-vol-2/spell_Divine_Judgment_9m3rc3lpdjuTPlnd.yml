    value: >-
      <p>A brilliant sword of radiant energy forms above the target point and
      slams down in an explosion of divine power. Each creature in a
      10-foot-radius, 30-foot high cylinder centered on the target point must
      make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 2d8 radiant
      damage, and 2d8 additional radiant damage if it is an undead or fiend. On
      a success, it takes half as much damage. </p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level
      or higher, the base damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
      2nd.</p><blockquote><h5>Alignment Powers</h5><p>If your DM uses alignment
      for creatures, they can optionally rule that the bonus damage applies all
      creature types as long as the creature is of the opposite moral alignment
      of the caster (evil to good or good to evil). As not all settings use
      strict alignment, this is a variant rule at the GMâ€™s
      discretion.</p></blockquote>
