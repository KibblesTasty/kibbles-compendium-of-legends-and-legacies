      <p>When you expend a spell slot to empower a spirit with your Call Spirit
      feature, you can select a number of skills equal to the spell slot
      expended that the spirit is proficient in. While it is not manifested, you
      gain proficiency with these skills. If you expend a spell slot of 5th
      level or higher, you can exchange three of the skills the spirit gaining
      expertise in one skill.</p>
