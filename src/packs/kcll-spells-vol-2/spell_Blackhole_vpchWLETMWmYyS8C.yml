      <p>You create a miniature black hole at a point within range. An event
      horizon forms in a 15-foot radius around the point, engulfing anything
      (including light, sound, and magical effects) in the area.</p><p>When the
      black hole appears, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make a
      Dexterity saving throw to avoid being engulfed. On a success, it can move
      up to its movement speed out of the event horizon of the black hole. If it
      cannot move to a safe space outside of the event horizon, it automatically
      fails the save and is engulfed.</p><p>An engulfed creature is compressed
      into the point at the center of the spell, taking 12d12 bludgeoning damage
      at the start of each of its turns while engulfed. Its speed is 0, and it
      is blinded, deafened, and restrained while engulfed. As an action, an
      engulfed creature can attempt to forcibly exit the black hole by making a
      Strength ability check against your spell save DC. On a success, the
      creature appears in an empty space at the edge of the event
      horizon.</p><p>Any spells, effects, terrain, or items that are not being
      worn or carried that are engulfed within the event horizon vanish and are
      destroyed. Magical items of Legendary or Artifact rarity are not
      destroyed, instead reappearing on the ground where the sphere was when the
      spell ends.</p><p>While the spell persists, all movement away from it
      while within 120 feet of it is considered difficult terrain. All ranged
      attacks that pass within 120 feet of it have disadvantage. When a creature
      starts its turn within 120 feet of the black hole, it is pulled 5 feet
      toward the black hole. At the start of the caster’s turn, all objects
      within 120 feet of the black hole that weigh less than 1000 pounds, are
      not being worn or carried, and are not attached to the ground are pulled
      20 feet toward the black hole.</p>
