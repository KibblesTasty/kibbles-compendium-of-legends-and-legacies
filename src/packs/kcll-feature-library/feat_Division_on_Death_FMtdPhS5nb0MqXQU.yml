      <p>Starting at 14th level, when you would drop to 0 hit points, you can
      instead explode into drops of ooze (no action required). All creatures of
      your choice within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw, or
      take 3d6 + your Charisma modifier acid damage, after which you leave
      behind a number of small acidic blobs equal to your Charisma modifier.
      Each one has an AC of 8, and 10 hit points, each placed in the closest
      available space to where to where you were before dividing. The blobs are
      creatures. They automatically fail all strength and dexterity saving
      throws, but use your statistics for other saving throws.</p><p>At the
      start of your next turn, all remaining blobs combine to reform your body,
      granting you hit points equal to their combined hit points. If all of them
      were destroyed, you reform at 0 hit points.</p><p>Once you use this
      ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
