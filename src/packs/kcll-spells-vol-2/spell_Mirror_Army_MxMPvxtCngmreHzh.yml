  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create an illusory duplicate of every allied creature of your
      choice within 30 feet. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move alongside
      their real counterparts and mimic their actions, making it impossible to
      track which is real.</p><p>Each time an affected creature is attacked,
      roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets the duplicate.
      On a roll of 11 or higher, the attack targets the duplicate. A duplicate's
      AC equals 10 + the real creature’s Dexterity modifier. If a duplicate is
      hit by an attack, it is destroyed. Duplicates ignore all other damage and
      effects, and the spell ends once all duplicates have been
      destroyed.</p><p> A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see,
      if it relies on senses other than sight (such as blindsight), or if it has
      truesight or another means of automatically disbelieving illusions.</p>
