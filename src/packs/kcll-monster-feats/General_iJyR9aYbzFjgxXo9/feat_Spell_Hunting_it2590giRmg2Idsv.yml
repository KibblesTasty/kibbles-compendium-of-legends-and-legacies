  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Some monsters specialize in hunting down spell casters, either through
      their nature or special training to take them out before their spells
      wreak havoc. This feat is most appropriate for intelligent enemies that
      might have had special wizard-punching-training or monsters that designed
      or adapted to hunting spellcasters. The monster gains the following
      features:</p><ul><li><strong>Magic Resistance.</strong> The creature has
      advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical
      effects.</li><li><strong>Reflexive Interruption.</strong> If a creature
      casts a spell while within reach of the monster, it can immediately make
      an attack using any attack available in its actions against the caster.
      This attack takes place before the spell completes. The caster must make a
      Concentration check as if it were concentrating on the spell it was
      casting. On failure, the spell fails to cast, spending the casting action,
      but not the spell slot (if the spell would have consumed a spell slot) or
      use of the feature (if limited).</li><li><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong>
      +Â½</li></ul>
