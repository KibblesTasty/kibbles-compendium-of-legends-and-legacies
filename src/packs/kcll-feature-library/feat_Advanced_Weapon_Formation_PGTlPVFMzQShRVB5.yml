      <p>Starting at 7th level, when you manifest or morph your Spirit Weapon,
      you can take advantage of its unique nature to imbue it with exotic
      properties that would otherwise be impossible. You can select one of the
      following properties when you manifest or change its
      form:</p><ul><li><strong>Enlarged Form.</strong> The Spirit Weapon grows
      one size larger, but your bond with it allows you to wield it
      effortlessly. It deals an additional 1d4 damage on
      hit.</li><li><strong>Extended Form.</strong> The weapon narrows and
      extends, gaining the Reach property. If it already has the reach property,
      its reach increases by 5 feet.</li><li><strong>Shield Form.</strong> The
      spirit can take the form of a Shield, and you can equip it as part of its
      manifestation or when it changes its form. If the spiritâ€™s weapon form has
      a bonus to attack and damage rolls, that bonus becomes a bonus to AC while
      in this form. You can form both a shield and weapon at the same
      time.</li></ul>
