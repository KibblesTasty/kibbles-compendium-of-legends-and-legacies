      <p>Starting at 10th level, you can see the flow of battle, giving time to
      exploit openings and opportunities. When a creature you can see misses you
      with an attack, you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack against
      that target or use a psionic power against them. When using a psionic
      power with this reaction, you cannot expend psi points to empower it, but
      can use Influence Points.</p>
