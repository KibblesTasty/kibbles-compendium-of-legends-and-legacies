    value: >-
      <p>You are resourceful and skilled when it comes the use of harpoons,
      gaining the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength or Constitution ability score by
      1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Throwing Arm.</strong> The normal
      range of your thrown weapons is doubled.</li><li><strong>Harpoon.</strong>
      As an action, you can use 30 feet of rope to turn any javelin, spear, or
      trident into a harpoon. When you throw that harpoon at a target 30 feet or
      less from you, you can pull it back to your hand as a bonus action. If the
      attack hit the target and the target is no more than one size larger than
      you, when you pull the harpoon back to you, you can force the target to
      make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Strength modifier +
      your proficiency bonus. On failure, you drag the target up to 20 feet
      toward you.</li></ul>
