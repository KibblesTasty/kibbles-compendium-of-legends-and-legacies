    value: >-
      <p>You create a false sky above you, filled with gleaming stars, which
      immediately begin to rain down. When you cast the spell, 3 stars
      immediately fall, with 1 additional star falling at the start of each of
      your turns for the duration. For each falling star, choose a creature
      within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw,
      taking 4d8 radiant damage on a failure or half as much on a success. A
      creature cannot be targeted by more than one falling star in a turn.
      </p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
      spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of stars that fall in the
      initial cast and on subsequent turns increases by 1 for each slot level
      above 4th.</p>
