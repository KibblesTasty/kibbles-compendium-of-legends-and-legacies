    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you are pragmatic and deadly in eliminating your
      foes. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't
      taken a turn in the combat yet, or when an allied creature within 5 feet
      of the target is directly on the other side of a creature.</p>
