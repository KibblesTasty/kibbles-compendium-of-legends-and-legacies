      <p>When you reach 13th level, as an action, you can perform a medical
      miracle to bring back a recently deceased creature that has died within
      the last minute. When you do, it is returned to life with 1 hit point +
      twice your proficiency modifier in temporary hit points. The creature
      gains 1 level of &amp;Reference[Exhaustion] and cannot be revived by this
      feature again until it completes a long rest.</p><p>Additionally, your
      Patch Up feature can now cure the Stunned and Petrified conditions.</p>
