    value: >-
      <p>You impart great heft to an unarmed strike or weapon you are holding.
      The first time you hit with a melee weapon attack using that weapon before
      the start of your next turn, your blow strikes with great force, and the
      attack deals an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage to the target and must
      succeed a Constitution saving throw, or becomes &amp;Reference[dazed]
      until the start of its next turn. While dazed this way, it cannot take
      reactions, and attacks against it have advantage.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level
      or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
      2nd.</p>
