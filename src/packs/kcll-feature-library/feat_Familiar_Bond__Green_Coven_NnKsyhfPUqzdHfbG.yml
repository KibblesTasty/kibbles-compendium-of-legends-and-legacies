    value: >-
      <p>When you complete a long rest, your familiar gains a number of illusory
      duplicates equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of one). These persist
      until destroyed by taking damage or you complete a long rest. The illusory
      duplicates cannot take any actions, but move and act like your familiar
      during your turn, staying within 30 feet of you or it.</p><p> At the end
      of your familiar’s turn or when it takes damage, it can swap places with
      an illusory familiar (no action required by the familiar). If it does this
      as a result of taking damage, the illusory familiar is destroyed but the
      familiar takes no damage. Illusory duplicates are immune to damage while
      within 5 feet of you. </p><p>Unless otherwise specified, illusory
      familiars occupy the Witch’s space and move with them.</p>
