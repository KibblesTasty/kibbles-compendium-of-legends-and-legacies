      <p>Additionally at 7th level, if you are carrying a melee weapon with the
      light property, you can make a single attack with it as a bonus action.
      You can expend Leadership Dice to make additional attacks as part of the
      same action, but each attack must be against a different target within
      range. If you have taken Dancer's Dodge, You can attack one additionally
      target (as if you'd spent a Leadership Die on the ability).</p>
