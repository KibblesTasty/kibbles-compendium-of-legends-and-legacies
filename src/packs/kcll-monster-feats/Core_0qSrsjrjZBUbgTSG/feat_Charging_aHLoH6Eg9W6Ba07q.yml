    value: >-
      <p>For monsters that move with bursts of speed and momentum to chase down
      or break through foes, excelling at surging power and heavy momentum. This
      feat is most appropriate for monsters larger than the players, four legged
      monsters, or monsters that are both heavy and fast. It grants the monster
      the following feature:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Heavy Charge (Recharge
      5–6).</strong> As part of its multiattack action (or as an action if it
      lacks the multiattack action), the monster charges up to 30 feet or its
      movement speed (which is shorter) in a straight line. Any creature in its
      path must make a Strength saving throw with a DC of 8 + STR mod + PB,
      taking PBd6 + STR mod damage and being knocked &amp;Reference[prone] on a
      failed save, or taking half as much damage and not being knocked prone on
      a successful save. This movement allows it to pass through the spaces of
      other creatures with no penalty to movement and without taking attacks of
      opportunity, but if a creature one size smaller or larger than the
      charging creature succeeds a saving throw against the ability, their
      charge is stopped.</p></li><li><p><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong>
      +½</p></li></ul>
