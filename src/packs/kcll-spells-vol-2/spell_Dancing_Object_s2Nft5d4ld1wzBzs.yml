      <p>You bring a Tiny nonmagical object that is not being worn or carried to
      life. The object uses the following
      stats:</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-monsters.Actor.yqDxHTe6zkrppqni]{Dancing
      Object}</p><p>If the object is a weapon, it deals the weapon’s damage dice
      + your Spellcasting modifier of the weapon’s damage type instead. The
      spell can only animate one-handed weapons without the special property
      this way.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can mentally command the animated
      object as long as it is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the
      creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can
      issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or
      corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself
      against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to
      follow it until its task is complete.</p><p> If the object is securely
      attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a
      wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is
      blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit
      points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage
      carries over to its original object form.</p>
