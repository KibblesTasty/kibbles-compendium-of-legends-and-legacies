    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 7th level, your mastery of telekinetic manipulation of your
      blade is so complete you can command it remotely and even use it as a mode
      of transport. You can stand on your sword to treat it as a
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.hFAVm9pTJDm0nu3g]{Broom of Flying},
      though only you can ride it, and anything being carried by it is dropped
      if you attack with it.</p><p>Additionally, the range of your Flying Sword
      attacks are doubled.</p>
