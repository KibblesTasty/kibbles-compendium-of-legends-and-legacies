    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, you are followed by a perpetual wispy fog. When
      you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, the fog thickens, lightly
      obscuring the area within a 10 foot radius of you for a number of rounds
      equal to the level of the spell cast. This thickened fog leaves a sodden
      rime on creatures of your choice within it, leaving them vulnerable to
      your magic. This rime fades as soon as they leave the area of the
      fog.</p><p>You have advantage on spell attack rolls against creatures
      effected by this rime, and creatures effected by this rime within the fog
      are under the effect of the bane spell when saving against your
      spells.</p>
