      <p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the
      ability to cast spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of
      spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the cleric spell
      list.</p><h5>Cantrips</h5><p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from
      the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice
      at 10th level.</p><h5>Spell Slots</h5><p>The Green Knight Spellcasting
      table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of
      1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot
      of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
      you finish a long rest.</p><h5>Spells Known of 1st-Level and
      Higher</h5><p>You know three 1st-level druid spells of your choice from
      the druid spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Green Knight
      Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st level or
      higher.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one
      of the druid spells you know with another spell of your choice from the
      druid spell list.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Wisdom is your
      spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since you learn your spells
      through faith and conviction. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers
      to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier
      when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when
      making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 +
      your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack
      modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
