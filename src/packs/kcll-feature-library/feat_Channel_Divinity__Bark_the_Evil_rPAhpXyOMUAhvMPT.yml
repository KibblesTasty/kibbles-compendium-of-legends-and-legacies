      <p>As an action, you can unleash a ferocious storm of holy barks to drive
      away evil. All non-allied creatures within 30 feet of you and that can see
      or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its
      saving throw, it is turned for 1 round or until it takes damage. A turned
      creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it
      can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also
      can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or
      try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s
      nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. </p><p>If the
      creature is on your property, it has disadvantage on the saving throw.</p>
