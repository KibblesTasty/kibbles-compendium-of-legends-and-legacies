    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, you can cast augury a number of times equal to
      your Wisdom modifier per day before it starts having a chance to return
      random answers.</p><p>Additionally, when you divine the future with
      augury, you can issue a cryptic prophecy, with three specific points for
      rolls that may occur within the next 30 minutes. For each specific point
      you prophesize, if you specify only the type of roll (for example, an
      attack, a Strength (Athletics) check, or an initiative roll, etc), a d4 is
      reserved (example "someone will be particularly quick when rolling
      initiative").</p><p>If you specify a specific action and a specific
      person, a d6 is reserved (for example, "when the wizard Caius rolls for
      initiative, he will be unusually quick"). If you give it a specific
      unlikely condition, a d8 can be reserved at the discretion of the
      GM.</p><p>A specific action or person can only have one prophesied event.
      If that prophesied event takes place (at the discretion of the GM it has
      occurred), the oracle can spend the reserved die and add it to the roll;
      if multiple events trigger the prophecy, the oracle can select which of
      them is affected by the reserved die.</p>
