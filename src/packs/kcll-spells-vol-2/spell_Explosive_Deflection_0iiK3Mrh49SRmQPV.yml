    value: >-
      <p>You release an explosive blast of energy to deflect an attack. Roll 2d6
      and reduce the attack's damage by the result. If the attack's damage was
      reduced to 0, and it was a melee attack, the attacker takes the remainder
      of your dice roll as thunder damage. </p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level
      or higher, the dice rolled increase by 1d6 for each slot level above
      2nd.</p>
