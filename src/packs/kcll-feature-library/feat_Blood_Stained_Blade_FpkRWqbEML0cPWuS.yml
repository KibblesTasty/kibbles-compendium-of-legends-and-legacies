  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, when you select this archetype, you gain special
      affinity when wielding a blood-coated weapon. For 1 minute after that
      melee weapon deals 1 or more points of damage to a living creature that
      has blood, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your
      Strength or Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls with that
      weapon. A weapon bloodied in this way is consider magical for the purposes
      of overcoming resistance to non-magical damage.</p><p> You can sacrifice 1
      of your own hit point at any time (no action required) to bloody a blade
      activating this effect.</p>
