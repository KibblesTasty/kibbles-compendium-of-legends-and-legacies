  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a reaction to a creature rolling a save, ability check, or attack
      roll, you search all possible timelines and merge the outcome you desire
      with reality. Select a value from 1 to 20 as the outcome of the roll. An
      unwilling creature can attempt to resist by making a Charisma saving
      throw; on a success, the spell has no effect.</p><p> Once you cast this
      spell, you cannot cast it again until 24 hours have passed.</p>
