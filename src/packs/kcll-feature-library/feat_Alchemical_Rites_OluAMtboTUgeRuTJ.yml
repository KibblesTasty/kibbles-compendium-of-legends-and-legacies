      <p>You gain proficiency with alchemy tools. During a long rest, you can
      use them to concoct an improvised potion of healing spending 1 hour of the
      long rest to tend to it's simmering. Due to its improvised nature, it
      expires in 24 hours, and has no value in gold pieces.</p>

      <p>During this process, you can expend a 5th level spell to make it a
      greater healing potion. The expended spell slot is regained when the long
      rest is completed as normal.</p>
