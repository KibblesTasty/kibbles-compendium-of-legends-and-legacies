      <p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain an alternate use for
      Wild Shape. As a bonus action, you assume a treelike form, covered in
      leaves and bark, which lasts up to one hour, or until you end it as a
      bonus action or until you are incapacitated. You gain the following
      properties when you transform:</p><ul><li><strong>Large Sized.</strong>
      You can make yourself Large sized. If you do so, your reach becomes 10
      feet.</li><li><strong>Grappling Roots.</strong> You can make a Wisdom
      (Athletics) check to initiate, maintain, or contest a grapple, and have a
      number of grappling appendages (in the form of grasping roots or branches)
      equal to your Wisdom modifier.</li><li><strong>Natural Weapons.</strong>
      Each appendage serves as a natural weapon under the effect of shillelagh.
      While in this form, you can cast shillelagh on any weapon you are
      carrying.</li><li><strong>Durable Bark.</strong> Your AC is 10 + your
      Constitution modifier + your Wisdom modifier. You cannot benefit from the
      AC of armor or shields while in this form.</li><li><strong>Temporary Hit
      Points.</strong> You gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom
      modifier + twice your Druid level when you transform into tree form. When
      the form ends, you lose any temporary hit points you have from
      it.</li><li><strong>Reinforced Form.</strong> When you take this form, you
      can expend a 1st level or higher spell slot. When you do so, the temporary
      hit points you gain increases by 1d8 per level of the spell slot
      spent.</li><li><strong>Ponderous Movement.</strong> Any speed you have
      becomes 15 feet, unless the speed was lower. If you don’t move during your
      turn, you have advantage on Ability Checks and Saving Throws against
      effects that would move you or knock you prone.</li></ul><p>You choose
      whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your
      new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM
      decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of
      equipment. Your equipment doesn’t change to match the new form, and any
      equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or
      merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you
      leave the form. You can cast spells as normal while in this form.</p>
