    value: >-
      <p>You lay your hand on dirt or rock and call on the stone to shape itself
      to your command. You can make any roughly shaped Small or Tiny item from
      the stone, including functional simple or martial melee weapons. Created
      items possess magical durability to resist shattering or breaking. This
      spell can't be used to carve significant amounts of material away from
      stone walls, doors, or other large objects.</p><p>Alternatively you can
      encase your limbs in stone, causing your unarmed strikes to deal 1d8
      bludgeoning damage for the duration of the spell.</p><p>Items made this
      way lose any magical durability after one hour, and become easily broken
      if they would not normally be functional in that shape. You can have three
      items or effects created by this cantrip at a time, and upon creating a
      fourth the oldest one loses its magical durability and becomes easily
      broken.</p>
