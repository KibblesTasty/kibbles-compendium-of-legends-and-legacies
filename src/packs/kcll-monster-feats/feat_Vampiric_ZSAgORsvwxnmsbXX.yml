      <p>This monster feeds on its target in an extremely effective manner. This
      doesn’t include just vampires, but can include any monsters that consume
      their targets either directly or more metaphorically (from an ooze
      literally devouring its target piece by piece to grow to psionic monsters
      that consume the minds of the targets).</p><p>It can even take the form a
      monster the feeds on the pain and suffering of its targets, such as a
      cursed shadow dragon. The monster gains the following
      feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Vampiric.</strong> The monster regains hit
      points equal to the damage it does.</li><li><strong>CR
      Adjustment:</strong> ×1.5</li></ul><section class="secret"
      id="secret-Z7WU57cxbPf5sfjE"><h5>Tactical Hint</h5><p>Though this ability
      can be quite fight warping, there is no trick to it beyond crowd control
      and potentially evasive maneuvers such as dodging to prevent it from
      hitting.</p></section>
