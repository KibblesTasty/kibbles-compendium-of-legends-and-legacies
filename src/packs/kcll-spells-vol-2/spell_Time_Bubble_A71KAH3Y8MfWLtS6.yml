    value: >-
      <p>You create a bubble of accelerated time in a 20-foot radius around a
      point you can see within range. When you cast the spell, initiative
      (including your current turn) is interrupted, and all creatures within the
      bubble can take an additional turn immediately (following the initiative
      order). Nothing inside the bubble can reach outside it or affect creatures
      outside. Any attacks passing through the bubble miss and any spells
      passing through it fail. If a creature exits the bubble, its additional
      turn immediately ends. </p><p>If any creature is only partly within the
      bubble when you cast the spell, the spell fails.</p><p>After every
      creature inside the bubble has acted, the spell ends and you resume your
      turn, with initiative proceeding as normal.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the
      creatures inside the bubble take two rounds of turns before the spell
      ends.</p>
