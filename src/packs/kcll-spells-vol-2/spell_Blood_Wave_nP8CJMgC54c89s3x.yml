    value: >-
      <p>You release a wave of magical blood that spreads out in a 15-foot cone.
      Creatures in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a
      creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 necrotic damage and is
      knocked &amp;Reference[prone]. On a success, it takes half as much damage
      and is not knocked prone.</p><p>If the wave kills a creature or passes
      over a corpse that has died within the last minute, it grows, increasing
      its size by 5 feet (e. g. it becomes a 20-foot cone). It can increase to
      up to twice its original size. Creatures without blood don't trigger this
      effect.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels. </strong>When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell’s range increases by
      5 feet and the necrotic damage increases by 1d6 damage for each slot level
      above 2nd.<br /></p>
