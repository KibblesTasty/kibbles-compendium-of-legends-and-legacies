    value: >-
      <p>You seize control of the blood within a freshly slain corpse or
      unconscious creature. The target must be Medium or smaller, and cannot
      have died more than 1 minute ago. For the duration, you can use your bonus
      action to make the target move up to 20 feet and make a single melee
      attack. It uses your spellcasting modifier for the attack roll.<br />If
      the corpse is carrying a weapon or has a natural weapon, the attack deals
      the weaponâ€™s damage (without any bonuses from the target's features).
      Otherwise, it makes a Slam attack which deal 1d6 (or 1 for a Tiny target)
      + your spellcasting modifier damage. </p><p>If an unconscious target
      regains consciousness within the spell's duration, it can make a Charisma
      saving throw at the end of each of its turns to regain control of its
      body. You can end this spell at any time (no action
      required).</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this
      spell with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the target can be
      Large.<br /></p>
