      <p>Starting at 17th level, you can astrally project your soul out of your
      body as an action. When you do so, your body becomes stunned and
      incapacitated, but you can act in your astral form. While in your astral
      form, you have the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Astral
      Form.</strong> Your astral form is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and
      slashing damage.</li><li><strong>Flying Speed.</strong> You gain a flying
      speed equal to your movement speed, and can
      hover.</li><li><strong>Ethereal.</strong> You can pass through physical
      objects and creatures as if they are difficult terrain, but cannot end
      your turn inside another creatures or objects’ space, being moved to the
      last unoccupied space you occupied if you try.</li><li><strong>Planar
      Shift.</strong> You can move between your current plane and the ethereal
      plane as an action. While on the ethereal plane, you can see and hear the
      plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can’t
      see anything there more than 60 feet away.</li></ul><p>Otherwise, your
      astral form shares all abilities and statistics with your normal form.
      While you use this ability, your Primal Interdiction projects from your
      astral form instead of your body. When you use this ability, you can
      project yourself to any plane or location you are familiar with. If your
      astral form is reduced to 0 hit points, you are returned to your body and
      regain 1 hit point. You can end the project at any time as a bonus action,
      returning to your body.</p>
