    value: >-
      <p>You gesture at a point you can see within range and call forth gnarled
      roots of dark energy, which erupt from the ground in a 60-foot radius.
      Each creature of your choice in the area must succeed on a Dexterity
      saving throw or be &amp;Reference[restrained] as the shadowy plant
      tendrils grasp and drain the life from it. </p><p>At the start of a
      restrained creature’s turn, it takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage and 2d10
      necrotic damage. Each time a creature takes necrotic damage from this
      spell, you regain 1d4 hit points. </p><p>A restrained creature can use its
      action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its
      choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. A
      creature can also be freed by destroying the tendril that grips it. The
      tendrils have AC 10 and 20 hit points, and are immune to all damage except
      radiant and fire. Spells that deal radiant or fire damage to creatures in
      the area of effect also affect any tendrils gripping them. </p><p>Any
      creature ending its turn within the radius while not restrained must make
      a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained by the tendrils.</p>
