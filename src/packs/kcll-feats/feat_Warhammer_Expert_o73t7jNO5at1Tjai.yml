    value: >-
      <p>Your mastery over a warhammer ensures that your blows never fail to
      wear down the enemy, becoming an inexorable threat to any foe. You gain
      the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength or Constitution ability score by
      1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Battering Blows.</strong> When you
      miss a melee weapon attack with the warhammer, the target takes half the
      weapon damage the attack would have dealt. This does not count as a hit
      for things that require you to hit the target (such as spells, Divine
      Smite, or similar features), but does include modifiers to the attack
      damage roll.</li></ul>
