      <p>Starting at 14th level, as an action when you are raging, you can start
      a Bladestorm. You can fling two light melee weapons you are carrying and
      pull any weapons already animated by Whirling Death into a wild vortex
      surrounding you. All creatures of your choice within 20 feet of you must
      make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus +
      your Strength modifier. On failure, they take 3d6 + your Strength modifier
      + your Rage bonus damage. The damage is increased by 1d6 for each Whirling
      Death weapon included (up to a maximum of +3d6). On success, a creature
      takes half as much damage.</p><p>On subsequent turns while raging, you can
      use your action to keep the Bladestorm going, forcing all creatures within
      20 feet of you to make the save again. You can keep a Bladestorm going for
      a number of turns equal to your Strength modifier. You can use this
      feature once per rage. When a bladestorm ends, all included weapons fall
      to the ground around you.</p>
