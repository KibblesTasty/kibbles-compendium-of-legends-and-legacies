    value: >-
      <p>You use maximize the effectiveness of a lance, gaining the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Impaled Movement.</strong> While you are
      mounted, if you strike a creature smaller than your mount with a lance,
      you can push that creature until the end of your turn, you make another
      attack, or you move in something other than a straight line. This movement
      counts as if you are grappling the creature for the duration of the
      movement, and your mounts movement speed is reduced to half while pushing
      them.</li><li><strong>Piercing Charge.</strong> When you hit an attack
      with a lance after traveling at least 10 feet, you can make an additional
      attack at another creature behind the target hit with disadvantage, as
      long as they are in reach of your weapon (you can move between attacks,
      but only in a straight line) with disadvantage. You can continue to repeat
      this until you miss, run out of movement, or run out of creatures in a
      line to hit.</li><li><strong>Expert Handling.</strong> A lance no longer
      requires two-hands when you aren’t mounted</li></ul>
