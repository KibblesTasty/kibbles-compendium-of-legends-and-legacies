      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your
      Cunning Action in new ways, gaining the following uses for the
      ability:</p><h5>Quick Treatment</h5><p>You can use your Cunning Action to
      use or administer a healing potion (any potion that restores hit points)
      or Healer’s Kit.</p><h5 id="surgical-assessment">Surgical
      Assessment</h5><p>You can assess the anatomical weaknesses of a creature
      that you can see. Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against a creature you
      can see, with a DC equal to the target’s AC. On success, you learn the
      target’s AC, and can use your Sneak Attack against that target even if you
      don’t have advantage on the attack roll. Additionally, if you deal Sneak
      Attack damage with a dagger against the target, you can reroll a number of
      Sneak Attack damage dice up to your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your
      choice, minimum 1). You must use the new rolls when rerolling dice. This
      benefit lasts for 10 minutes against a target.</p>
