    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, if your armor becomes damaged, you can repair it using
      the bones of a medium or larger creature’s corpse (provided it has bones).
      You can forge entirely new armor this way. Armor forged this way can be
      any mundane armor with a maximum value of 100 times your Warden level in
      gold pieces, and can only be used by you.</p><p> Additionally, while you
      are wearing armor created this way or that you’ve bonded with Mystic
      Bulwark, you gain proficiency with the Intimidation skill.</p>
