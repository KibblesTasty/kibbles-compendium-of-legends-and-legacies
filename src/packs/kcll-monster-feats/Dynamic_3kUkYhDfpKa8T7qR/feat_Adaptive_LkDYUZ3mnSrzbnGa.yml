    value: >-
      <p>A particularly difficult to damage monster, it can adapt to its
      environment with extreme proficiency. Most often found in oozes,
      elementals, golems, or other creatures of flexible
      nature.</p><ul><li><strong>Damage Adaption.</strong> Any time the monster
      takes damage, it gains resistance to that damage type (after taking the
      damage). It cannot have more than five damage resistances, and loses any
      resistance to any damage it has not taken for more than 1 minute. When it
      reaches five resistances, it loses the resistance to the damage took the
      longest ago when gaining a new resistance.</li><li><strong>CR

      class="secret"><h5>Tactical Hint</h5><p>To make defeating this monster
      easier, all you need to do is expose the mechanics of the ability, and
      perhaps point out some of the less used weapons or abilities at a players
      disposal.</p></section>
