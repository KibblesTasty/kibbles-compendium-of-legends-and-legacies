    value: >-
      <p>A vivid rainbow of prismatic lights springs out from your hand. Each
      creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
      failure, a creature is &amp;Reference[blinded] until the start of your
      next turn. On a success, a creature is not blinded but is disoriented by
      the brilliant flash and cannot make attacks of opportunity until the start
      of your next turn. </p><p>Creatures that are already blinded or cannot see
      you arenâ€™t affected as they do not see the burst.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level
      or higher, the size of the cone expands by 5 additional feet.</p>
