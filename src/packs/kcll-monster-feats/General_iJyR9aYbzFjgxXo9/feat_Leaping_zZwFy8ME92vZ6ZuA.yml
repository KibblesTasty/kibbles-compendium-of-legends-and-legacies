      <p>While all creatures can jump, this is a creature that has mastered both
      jumping and landing for maximum impact. This feat is most appropriate for
      monsters with powerful legs or partial flight abilities, such as wyverns,
      dragons, tigers, or similar. The monster gains the following
      feature:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Mighty Leap (Recharge 4–6).</strong> As
      part of its multiattack action (or as an action if it lacks the
      multiattack action), the monster can leap up to 20 feet (or its movement
      speed, whichever is shorter) without expending movement or provoking
      attacks of opportunity (it does not require a running start to leap this
      distance). It can leap to a space that is either unoccupied, or occupied
      by a creature smaller than it. Any creature that it lands on, or that is
      within 5 feet of its landing area, must make a Constitution saving throw
      with a DC of 8 + STR mod + PB, taking PBd6 + STR mod damage on failure and
      being knocked &amp;Reference[prone]. On success, the creature takes half
      as much damage and is not knocked prone. Targets in the space the monster
      lands in are ejected to nearest free space within 5 feet. If there is no
      free space within 5 feet, the automatically fail the save and cannot stand
      up until they are no longer sharing a space with
      creature.</p></li><li><p><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong> +1</p></li></ul>
