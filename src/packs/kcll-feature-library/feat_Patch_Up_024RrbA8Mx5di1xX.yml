    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 9th level, as an action, you can bandage a creature to help
      them recover. They gain hit points equal to 1d8 + your proficiency bonus,
      and you can cure them of one of the following conditions: Blinded,
      Deafened, Paralyzed, or Poisoned. Once a creature gains this benefit, they
      cannot gain it again until they complete a short or long rest.</p><p>
      During a short rest, you can perform this action on up to six beasts or
      humanoids that have not already gained its benefit.</p>
