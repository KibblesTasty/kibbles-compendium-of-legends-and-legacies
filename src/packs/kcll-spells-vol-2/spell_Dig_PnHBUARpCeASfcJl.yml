  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Until the end of your turn, you gain a burrowing speed of 30 feet. You
      can move through dirt, sand, or clay with this movement, and leave behind
      a tunnel equal to your size that remains stable for 1 minute (after which
      it may remain or collapse based on the properties of the ground moved
      through). You cannot move through stone (natural or constructed) with this
      movement.</p>
