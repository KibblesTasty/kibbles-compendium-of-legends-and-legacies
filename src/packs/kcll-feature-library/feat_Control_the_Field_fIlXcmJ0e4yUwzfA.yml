      <p>Starting at 7th level, when you use an ability that moves allied
      creatures (such as Urgent Orders or Shift the Field), it gains the
      following properties:</p><ul><li><strong>Deceptive Movement: </strong>You
      can attempt to move creatures that are not allies up to 5 feet (or half
      their movement speed, whichever is less). The creature must make an
      Intelligence Saving Throw with a DC of 8 + your Intelligence modifier +
      your Proficiency bonus, or feel compelled to move to the new position
      immediately. Targets moved this way do not gain temporary hit
      points.</li><li><strong>Flanking Maneuvers:</strong> If two allies you
      move are on opposite sides of a creature after the movement you grant, the
      first one to attack that enemy has advantage on their first attack if they
      attack before the creature moves.</li><li><strong>Coordinated
      Transitions:</strong> Allies can move through each other's spaces during
      the movement you grant without it being difficult terrain.</li></ul>
