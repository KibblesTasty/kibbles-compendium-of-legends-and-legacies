    value: >-
      <p>You unleash a sweeping tide of blood along the ground, transforming the
      terrain into difficult terrain for all creatures but yourself until the
      start of your next turn. Each creature in the area when you cast the spell
      must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage
      on a failure or half as much on a success.</p><p>At the start of your next
      turn, the tide recedes as the spell ends, collecting the blood and
      returning it to you, restoring the 10 hit points used to cast the
      spell.<br /></p>
