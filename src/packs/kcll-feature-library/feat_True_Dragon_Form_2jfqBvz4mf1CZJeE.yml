    value: >-
      <p>When you use @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.QbQZKoXOgHWN06aa]{true
      polymorph} on yourself to take the form of a dragon and allow it to become
      a permanent effect, the effect cannot be dispelled, and for all intents
      and purposes of the rules, you become a dragon. This does not revert even
      if you die, and can only be reversed by wish if you allow it to be.</p>
