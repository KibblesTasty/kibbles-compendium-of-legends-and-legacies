      <p>At 1st level, you can protect and guide the dreams of others around
      you. Up to 4 + your Cleric level other creatures of your choice sleeping
      within 120 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against beings
      intruding into their dreams or influencing their
      dreams.</p><p>Additionally, when they take a long rest and sleep during
      that rest, you can shape and guide their dreams to grant them tranquil
      sleep or prophetic preparations. You can apply one of the following
      options to all affected creatures:</p><ul><li><strong>Focused
      Dreams.</strong> The creature gains the effect of guidance on a number of
      skill checks equal to your proficiency bonus of their choice, losing any
      unused uses when they complete their next long
      rest.</li><li><strong>Restful Dreams.</strong> The creature regains
      additional expended hit dice equal to one quarter of your Cleric level
      (rounded down).</li><li><strong>Tranquil Dreams.</strong> The creature
      gains 1d4 + your Cleric level temporary hit points at the end of their
      long rest.</li></ul>
