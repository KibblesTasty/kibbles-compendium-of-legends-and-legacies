      <p>As a magically alive force, you are weakened while in the area of an
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ]{antimagic field}. At
      the start of each turn you spend it, you must make a DC 10 Charisma saving
      throw. On failure, you have disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability
      checks, and your speed is halved. If you fail by 5 or more, you are
      stunned until the end of your turn. </p><p>If you are the target of
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic}, you
      must succeed a Charisma saving throw against the caster's spell save DC
      (even if the caster is an allied creature). On failure, you are stunned
      until the end of your next turn.</p>
