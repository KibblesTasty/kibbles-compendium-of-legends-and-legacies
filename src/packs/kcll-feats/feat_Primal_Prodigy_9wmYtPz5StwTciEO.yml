      <p>Your connection to the primal power grows stronger. You learn one
      additional Primal Manifestation from the Warden Primal Manifestation list.
      You cannot select a manifestation you already know, or one that requires a
      level restriction, even if you are already of that level. You can only
      select one with a prerequisite of a subclass if you have at least one
      level in that subclass.</p>
