      <p>Starting at 17th level, you can physically enter dreams to travel, gain
      information, or influence them. When you fall asleep, or as an action
      while awake, you can enter the ethereal realm of dreams for up to an hour.
      You can exit the realm of dreams as a bonus action. You can only exit the
      realm of dreams within 120 feet of where you entered, or within 5 feet of
      a sleeping creature. While in the realm of dreams, you can do any of the
      following:</p><ul><li><strong>Dream Passage.</strong> Teleport to a
      location youâ€™ve been to before or a person you are familiar with (though
      you can only exit the dream realm there if there is a sleeping person to
      use as a conduit).</li><li><strong>Cast Dream.</strong> Cast the dream
      spell once without expending a spell slot, after which you cannot do so
      again until next you enter the dream realm.</li><li><strong>Search
      Dreams.</strong> Search for information from the dreams of others, making
      a Wisdom (Insight) check with a DC based on the difficulty of finding the
      information, or contested by a Deception check using Intelligence, Wisdom,
      or Charisma by the target if you are trying to acquire it from a specific
      target (their choice of which). If you fail a check to acquire a piece of
      information, you cannot ever attempt to acquire that piece of information
      again.</li></ul><p>You can enter the dream realm in this way once, after
      which you must complete a long rest before doing so again.</p>
