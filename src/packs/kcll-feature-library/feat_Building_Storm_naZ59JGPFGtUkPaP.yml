      <p>Starting at 1st level, when you cast a warlock spell of 1st level or
      higher using a Pact Magic spell slot on your turn, a storm begins to brew
      around you. The storm gains storm levels based equal to the level of the
      spell slot used. If you cast a spell while the storm is active, the storm
      level is increased by the level of the spell slot used (up to a maximum
      equal to your Charisma ability modifier).</p><p>While a storm is active
      around you, you gain the following abilities based on how powerful the
      storm is:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Storm</th><th>Level
      Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>You can cast manipulate
      wind as a bonus action.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>You can use your
      reaction to impose disadvantage on a ranged weapon attack made against a
      target within 15 feet of you.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>You gain a flying
      speed of 15 feet, though cannot fly more than 15 feet above the ground
      with this flying speed. </td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>If a creature ends
      their turn within 15 feet of you or strikes you with a melee attack, you
      can use your reaction to deal 1d8 lightning damage to
      them.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>You gain flying speed equal to your
      movement speed and are not longer restricted in how you can
      fly.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The storm loses 1 level each time you end
      your turn without casting a 1st level or higher spell. You can prevent
      this by concentrating on maintaining the storm (as if it were a spell)
      starting from any action that increases the stormâ€™s level. You can
      maintain this concentration for up to 1 minute.</p>
