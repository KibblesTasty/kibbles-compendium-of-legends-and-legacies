    value: >-
      <p>You cause an eruption of blood from the corpse of a Small or larger
      creature that had blood and was slain within the last minute. Each
      creature within 15 feet of the corpse must make a Dexterity saving throw.
      On a failure, it takes 3d8 necrotic damage and 3d8 thunder damage. On a
      success, it takes half as much damage.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level
      or higher, you can target one additional corpse for each slot level above
      3rd. A creature affected by multiple corpse explosions makes its saving
      throw at disadvantage, but only takes damage once.</p>
