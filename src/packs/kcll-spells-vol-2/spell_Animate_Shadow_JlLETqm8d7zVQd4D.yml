    value: >-
      <p>Targeting a creature you can see within range, you bring its shadow to
      life under your control. If the creature has a challenge rating above 3 or
      has no shadow (either due to its nature or from the lack of a light source
      to cast one) the spell fails. Creatures without a challenge rating are
      immune to this spell.</p><p>Otherwise, a copy of the creature is created
      using its game statistics in a space adjacent to the creature (on the
      opposite side as the nearest bright light). The shadow has no legendary
      actions, legendary resistance, and cannot cast spells. The shadow has hit
      points equal to half the targetâ€™s hit points, and it looks like a mirrored
      version of the creature it was summoned from, formed from inky black
      smoke. The shadow is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
      damage from non-magical sources while in darkness. The shadow is
      vulnerable to all damage while in bright light, and always vulnerable to
      fire, lightning, and radiant damage. If the shadow is killed, the target
      creature it was summoned from casts no shadows for the next 8
      hours.</p><p>The shadow acts immediately after the target's turn, and
      without further direction it attempts to follow and takes the Attack
      action against the target. As a reaction to the shadow starting its turn,
      you can exert control over it and cause it to move and take its action as
      you direct.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this
      spell using a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot, the maximum challenge rating
      of the target increases to 4. When you cast it using a 7th- or 8th-level
      spell slot, the maximum challenge rating increases to 5. When you cast it
      using a 9th-level spell slot, the maximum challenge rating increases to CR
      6.</p>
