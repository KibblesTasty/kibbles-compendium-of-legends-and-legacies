      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can infuse spells into your weapon. As a
      bonus action, you can cast a 1st level or higher Spellblade spell with a
      casting time of 1 action in a special way, infusing it into a melee weapon
      instead of having it immediately take effect. The next time you make a
      melee attack with that weapon before the end of your turn, the spell is
      cast against the target of the attack. The spell fizzles and fails to cast
      if you cast another spell before attacking.</p><p>Spellstrike’s
      interaction with the spell mechanics is determined by the spell’s
      effect:</p><ul><li><strong>Attack Rolls.</strong> If the spell requires an
      attack roll (melee or ranged) it automatically hits the target if the
      weapon attack hits and misses the target if the weapon attack
      misses.</li><li><strong>Saving Throws</strong>. If the spell has a saving
      throw, it automatically deals damage as if the target failed its saving
      throw against the spell on hit, but if it has any effects besides dealing
      damage, the target makes the save against those effects as normal for
      being targeted by the spell (regardless if the attack hits or misses). If
      a spell does half damage to targets that pass their save, they take half
      damage on a missed attack, treating it as if they had passed their saving
      throw. If a spell always hits (such as magic missile), the spell hits
      regardless if you hit or miss your attack.</li><li><strong>Area of
      Effect.</strong> If the spell has an area of effect, that area of effect
      must include the space the target of the Spellstrike is in, be placed such
      that one edge of it is within the range of your weapon, and otherwise
      follows the rules of the spell regarding placement and range. Other
      creatures caught in the area of effect treat the spell as if you had cast
      it normally. The target is not affected by the spell again (having already
      resolved as part of the attack).</li><li><strong>Multiple Attack
      Rolls.</strong> Spells that have multiple attack rolls (such as scorching
      ray or crackleK) tie the outcome of only the first attack roll to the
      melee weapon attack. You resolve all subsequent attack rolls of the spell
      as if you had cast the spell, but can ignore the disadvantage on ranged
      attack rolls from being within 5 feet of hostile creatures when doing
      so.</li></ul><p>You can only cast spells that are on the Spellblade class
      list using Spellstrike, and can only cast them at a level you can cast
      them as a Spellblade, though you can use any spell slot you have available
      to cast the spell.</p><blockquote><h3>Additional
      Clarifications</h3><p><strong>Critical Strikes.</strong> If the attack
      critically strikes, a spell that has a spell attack roll used with spell
      strike also critical strikes, but a spell that has a saving throw just
      treats it the same as a hit (inflict wounds would critical strike, but
      fireball would not, as it cannot critically
      strike).</p><p><strong>Condition Sequence.</strong> Any effects that
      require the target to fail a saving throw take place after the attack. For
      example, if you spellstrike hold person, the saving throw against being
      paralyzed (and the condition if they fail) take place after the attack
      roll is complete.</p><p><strong>Area of Effect.</strong> One edge of the
      spell must be in range of the weapon, but the center point of the spell
      does not need to be. For example, with spellstriking fireball, you don’t
      need to hit yourself with. One edge of the spell must be within range, and
      the target must be inside the area of effect, but the center point of the
      spell can further away.</p></blockquote>

      make a melee attack with that weapon before the end of your turn, the
      spell is cast against the target of the attack. The spell fizzles and
      fails to cast if you cast another spell before attacking.</p>
