    value: >-
      <p>You cause a creatureâ€™s blood to erupt outward in a violent spray. The
      target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 4d6
      necrotic damage, and every other creature within 10 feet of the target
      must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 necrotic damage from
      the blood spray. On a successful save, the target takes half as much
      damage and the blood spray does not occur. A creature without blood is
      immune to this spell.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels. </strong>When you
      cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, both the damage
      against the main target increase by 2d6 as well as the spray increasing by
      1d6 for each spell level above 2nd.<br /></p>
