    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, you can use your primal connection with the natural
      powers of the world to reshape the land around you on a large scale. This
      can take the form of effects like
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.x5JNBSyIBBZsjcGT]{earthquake},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ZPd73HtKF3At11jh]{control weather}, or
      a transmutation or conjuration spell from the Druid spell list that
      modifies the terrain (such as
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.NmoRmM1mhuM3pqnY]{wall of
      stone}).</p><p>At the GM's discretion, this might be used to accomplish
      other large scale feats not listed by a spell, such as changing the course
      of a river, quenching a forest fire, or causing an active volcano to have
      a small eruption. Its range effect should generally be contained with a 1
      mile radius area when not replicating the spells listed above. When used
      in this way it takes 1 minute to invoke the effect (which may take longer
      to fully manifest depending on its nature).</p><p>Once you do so, you
      cannot do so again until you complete a long
      rest.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Limits of Primal Decree</strong>
      </p><p>Primal Decree is invoking the will of nature to act on your behalf.
      Consequently, it should tend to have its strongest effects when enacted in
      accordance with that will (as determined by the DM). </p><p>Wardens who
      have an unusual bond with natural laws may be able to call on their
      related domain with a Primal Decree to similar results even if it would
      not normally fall under the scope of its powers, such as a Time Warden
      gaining the effect of time stop with Primal Decree</p></blockquote>
