  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, when you throw a weapon while raging it becomes
      animated with your fury. A whirling weapon stays spinning where it was
      thrown until the end of your next turn, and automatically attacks the
      first hostile creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of it using the
      attack and damage modifiers used to throw it. A creature can only take
      damage from this feature once per turn (meaning can be attacked a second
      time if the first attack misses, but not if it hits).</p><p> Additionally,
      you can use your reaction to make an attack of opportunity with any weapon
      animated by this feature if a target moves out of its reach.</p>
