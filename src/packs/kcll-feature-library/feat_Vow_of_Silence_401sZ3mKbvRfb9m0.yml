  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Some Paladins of this oath take their calling very seriously, and
      commit to never speaking again.</p><p>When you select this option, you
      gain the ability to speak telepathically to creatures with which you share
      at least one language with a range of 60 feet. This telepathy is one way,
      and they cannot reply. Additionally, all verbal components of spells (as
      well as the whispered prayers of your Channel Divinity options) are
      replaced by somatic components for you.</p><p>If you ever speak, this vow
      is broken and you lose these additional powers.</p>
