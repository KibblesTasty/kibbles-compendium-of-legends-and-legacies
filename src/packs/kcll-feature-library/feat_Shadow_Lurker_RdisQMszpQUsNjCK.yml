      <p>You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured, when
      you are hidden from a creature attacking that creature does not reveal
      your location if you miss, and dim light does not impose disadvantage on
      your Wisdom (Perception) ability checks, even when they rely on sight.</p>
