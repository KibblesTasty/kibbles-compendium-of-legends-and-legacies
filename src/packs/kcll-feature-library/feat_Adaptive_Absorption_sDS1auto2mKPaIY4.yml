      <p>Starting at 1st level when you make the pact, as a reaction to taking
      damage you can manipulate your body gaining resistance to the damage type
      of the attack until the start of your next turn. If the trigger of the
      reaction is taking damage from a melee weapon attack, you can force the
      attacker to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On
      failure, their weapon becomes stuck, forcing them to either release it, or
      become &amp;Reference[grappled] by you (their choice). As an action they
      can repeat the saving throw to retrieve a stuck weapon. You can release
      stuck weapons at any time (no action required).</p><p>You can use this
      feature a number of times equal to you proficiency bonus, regaining all
      uses when you complete a long rest</p>
