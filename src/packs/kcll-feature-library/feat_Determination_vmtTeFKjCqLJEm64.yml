      <p>Starting at 15th level, you can attempt to use your physical prowess to
      break through magical effects that are otherwise physically impassable. As
      an action, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check against the spell
      save DC of the caster to attempt to force your way through magical
      barriers or effects. On success, you can move through the effect, spending
      four feet of movement for each foot moved through the effect.</p>
