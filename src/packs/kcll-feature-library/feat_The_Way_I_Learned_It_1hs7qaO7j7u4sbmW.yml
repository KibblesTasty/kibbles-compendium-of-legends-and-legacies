      <p>You learn your magic through self-discovery, often encompassing trial
      and error. Not knowing what is supposed to be impossible or impractical,
      your magic develops unique aspects. You can modify spells you learn with
      the following feature. </p><p>When you learn a new Occultist spell, you
      can modify some of its properties representing your unique way of casting
      that spell. These changes permanently affect the spell for you, but when
      you swap out a spell when gaining a level in the class, you can instead
      modify these properties from a spell you know. You can learn the same
      spell multiple times with different selections (i.e. “ranged cure wounds”)
      You may apply any number of these properties when learning or modifying a
      spell. • </p><ul><li><p><strong>Damage Type</strong>. You can change any
      of the following damage types into another of the following damage types:
      acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.
      </p></li><li><p><strong>Range</strong>. You can make a spell with a range
      of 10 feet or more instead have a range of Touch, or give a spell with a
      range of Touch a range of up 10 feet (if it was a melee spell attack, it
      becomes a ranged spell attack if the range is greater than Touch).
      </p></li><li><p><strong>Components</strong>. You can exchange a verbal,
      somatic, or material component of a spell for another type of component
      the spell does not normally have, such as changing a spell from requiring
      verbal and somatic components, to requiring somatic and material
      components. Material components with a cost cannot be replaced, but can be
      exchanged for a different material component of equal cost.</p></li></ul>
