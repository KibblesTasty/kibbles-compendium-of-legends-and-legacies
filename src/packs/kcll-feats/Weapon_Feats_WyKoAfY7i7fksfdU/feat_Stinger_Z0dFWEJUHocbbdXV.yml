      <p>You specialize in the quiet and agonizing kill with subtle weapons. You
      gain the following benefits related to blowguns and
      darts:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase your
      Dexterity, Wisdom, or Constitution ability score by 1, to a maximum of
      20.</li><li><strong>Efficient Poisons.</strong> When you apply a poison
      blowgun needle or dart, you can apply it to twice as many pieces of
      ammunition.</li><li><strong>Hidden Death.</strong> If you attack while
      hidden from a target with a blowgun or dart, you can make a Dexterity
      (Stealth) check with a −5 penalty for each time you’ve hit the target this
      turn against their passive Wisdom (Perception) score (no action required).
      On a success, you remain hidden from that target, though the target will
      know which general direction you are in.</li></ul>
