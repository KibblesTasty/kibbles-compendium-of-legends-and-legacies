    value: >-
      <p>You cause a pillar of stone to rise from the ground in a space you can
      see within range. The pillar occupies a 5-foot space and rises up to 30
      feet into the air. The ground where it appears must have space to
      accommodate it, and you can't target a space under a Large or larger
      creature.</p><p>If a pillar is created under a Medium or smaller creature,
      that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the
      pillar. A creature can choose to fail its save. If a pillar is prevented
      from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a
      creature on the pillar takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage and is
      &amp;Reference[restrained], crushed between the pillar and the obstacle.
      The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics)
      or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the creature’s choice) against the spell
      save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must
      either move off the pillar or fall.</p><p>The pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit
      points. When reduced to 0 hit points, it crumbles into rubble, creating an
      area of difficult terrain in a 15-foot square centered on the pillar,
      which lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-square in the area
      requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p>
