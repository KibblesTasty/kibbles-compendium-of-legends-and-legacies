      <p>our body can be assembled if pieces are broken off. A lost limb can be
      reattached over a short rest while spending 1 or more hit dice as long as
      the limb is in your possession, and your corpse counts as intact if all
      pieces of it can be found and assembled for when using animate dead to
      recreate revivify on you</p>
