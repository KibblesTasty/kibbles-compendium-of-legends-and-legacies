      <p>You have an intuitive understanding of your allies movement, allowing
      to coordinate perfectly with their actions. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase
      your Dexterity, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1.</li><li><strong>Synchronized
      Movement.</strong> Your space is not difficult terrain for your allies,
      and allies can move into your space to make an attack, but still cannot
      end their turn your space (and cannot move into your space if they don't
      have the movement to move out of it).</li></ul>
