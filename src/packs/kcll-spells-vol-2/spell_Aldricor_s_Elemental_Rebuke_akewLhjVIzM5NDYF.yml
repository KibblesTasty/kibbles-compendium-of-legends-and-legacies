    value: >-
      <p>You manipulate some of the incoming elemental energy, harnessing its
      power in your hand. The damage you take from the triggering attack or
      effect is cut in half. You can then hurl the energy back at the creature
      that damaged you if it is within 60 feet of you. The creature must make a
      Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 damage of the triggering type on a
      failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>At
      Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd
      level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
      1st.</p>
