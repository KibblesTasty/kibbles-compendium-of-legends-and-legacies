      <p>By 14th level, when you enter a rage, you can massive dragon wings
      sprout from your back. If you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a
      flying speed equal to your movement speed.</p><p>If you choose to manifest
      natural weapons and wings when you enter a rage, you can choose entirely
      take on a draconic form while raging, becoming Large sized. When you take
      on a full draconic form, you choose whether your equipment falls to the
      ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it.</p>
