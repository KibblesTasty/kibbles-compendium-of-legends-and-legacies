      <p>You are the skeletal remains of what once was a living creature; you
      are both the power that animates these remains and bound to the remains
      themselves. The source of your second life varies—perhaps risen as a
      mindless undead by a necromancer you eventually awakened sentience,
      perhaps you are fey spirit that inhabited the bones and got stuck, or
      perhaps you fiendish creature bound to this form to walk the material
      plane—there are many options for how you ended up in this predicament, but
      beware, your new life is as fragile as any mortal, and you can die as they
      do.</p><p>This is a unique and flexible race where your exact nature
      depends on several factors of your circumstance and it presents unique
      traits and challenges, including some large conveniences and
      inconveniences that can lead to nonstandard circumstances, particularly
      around healing.</p><blockquote><h5>Being Undead is not
      Normal</h5><p>...usually. This is a race that will always be under the
      approval of a DM if fits with their setting and campaign. Being undead
      will not be a normal player experience: if your nature is revealed, the
      vast majority of creatures will find you either terrifying or a threat to
      be destroyed. Various disguises or illusions will almost always be
      required to interact with the living.</p></blockquote><h3>Awakened Undead
      Traits</h3><p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> As an undead, you
      have increased resilience. Your Constitution score and one other ability
      score of choice increase by 1. You gain one additional ability score
      increase from the type of Remains selected in your subrace
      choice.</p><p><strong>Age.</strong> Awakened undead are effectively
      ageless. Their age can be measured from when they have awakened, but they
      do not change with age beyond their lived experience from that
      point.</p><p><strong>Alignment.</strong> While typical undead are nearly
      universally evil due to the negative energy that animates them, there are
      other sources of undead animation that run a broader range of
      possibilities. Regardless of your animating force, what differentiates an
      Awakened Undead is awareness and control, and as such they can freely
      choose their alignment. Some will still choose evil, but others find a new
      path upon awakening.</p><p><strong>Size.</strong> Undead are typically
      animated from Medium sized humanoid corpses, and have sizes based on the
      creature they once were. Your size is Medium unless otherwise specified by
      your Remains type.</p><p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed
      is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Due to the unique nature of
      your sight, you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
      bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern
      color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong>
      You can speak, read, and write
      Common.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feature-library.Item.fSraAmuIrpN42kb5]{Undead

      extremely varied by their nature, and consequently create their subrace in
      a unique way by selecting two values: their remains, and their animating
      force. Their remains indicate what sort of corpse you are animating, and
      your the animating force dictates what sort of force is driving the
      animation.</p><p>Your selection of remains gives you an ability score
      (listed in the table below) which is increased by one, and a feature that
      is defined below. Your animating force gives a language known as well as a
      feature (also defined below). If the language is listed as "matching
      remains" it means the language of the type of corpse you are animating
      spoke in life (for example, for an elf corpse,
      Elvish).</p><h5>Remains</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Remains</th><th>Ability
