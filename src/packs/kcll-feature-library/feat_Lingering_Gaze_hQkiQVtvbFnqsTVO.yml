    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, when you invoke your Overseer’s Gaze, the spectral eye
      lasts for 1 minute before fading away, and you use your bonus action on
      each of turns to cause it to fire again, rolling on the table anew. Once
      during the duration of each eye, you can pick the effect it fires instead
      of rolling. The spectral eye moves with you and is always in your
      space.</p><p>While you have the spectral eye with you, have advantage on
      Wisdom (Perception) checks and can perform the Search action as a bonus
      action (instead of firing an eye ray).</p>
