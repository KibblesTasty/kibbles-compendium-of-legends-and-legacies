  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a ritual taking 1 hour, you can absorb the power from a magical
      weapon with a bonus to attack and damage rolls. This cannot target
      artifacts, sentient weapons, or cursed items. At your DMâ€™s discretion,
      this might not work with other weapons depending on their origin and type.
      This drains the power from the weapon, leaving it as a mundane weapon, but
      your Aethersword gains the bonus to attack and damage rolls previously
      possessed by the magical weapon.</p>
