      <p>Starting at 3rd level when you select this archetype, when you roll
      initiative or as a bonus action at any time, you can manifest an oversized
      melee weapon of pure force energy. This can take the shape of any bladed
      melee weapon, but it is a one-handed weapon that deals 1d10 force damage
      with a range of 5 feet regardless of its form.</p><p>When you attack with
      this weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier (in place of your
      Strength) for attack and damage rolls. This weapon lasts until you let go
      of it, become incapacitated, or dismiss it as a bonus action.</p><p> While
      this weapon is temporary and magical, it counts as having a value of 1 sp
      for purposes of being treated as a material component in spells.</p>
