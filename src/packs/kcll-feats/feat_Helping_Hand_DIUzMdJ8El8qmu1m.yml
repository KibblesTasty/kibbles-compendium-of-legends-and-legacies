      <p>You are always there to give your allies a hand. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase
      Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of
      20.</li><li><strong>Boosting Shoves.</strong> When a willing allied
      creature moves out of your reach, you can use your reaction to give them a
      boost, shoving them 5 feet. This occurs before any opportunity attack
      their movement might provoke, and may prevent them from taking an
      opportunity attack.</li><li><strong>Get Down.</strong> When an allied
      creature is forced to make a Dexterity saving throw while within 5 feet of
      you, you can use your reaction to shove them 5 feet, potentially out of
      the effect. If the effect is targeted, you can instead interpose yourself,
      giving them advantage on saving throw, but forcing you to save against the
      same effect.</li></ul>
