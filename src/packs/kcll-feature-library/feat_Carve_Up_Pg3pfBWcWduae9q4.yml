      <p>When you reach 17th level, you gain the ability to use your Surgical
      Assessment to determine how to disable a target most
      effectively.</p><p>Once per turn, when you make a melee weapon attack
      against a target under the effect of your Surgical Assessment, you can
      cripple it, inflicting one of the following
      conditions:</p><ul><li><strong>Hamstring.</strong> You impede the
      creature’s locomotion, halving its movement
      speed.</li><li><strong>Artery.</strong> You open a critical artery,
      causing it to take 4d4 piercing damage at the start of its
      turns.</li><li><strong>Larynx.</strong> You attack the creature’s vocal
      apparatus. The target is muted and cannot speak or perform verbal
      components.</li><li><strong>Eyes.</strong> You strike the creature’s eyes.
      The target is blinded.</li></ul><p>At the end of a crippled creature’s
      turns, it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Wisdom or
      Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus). On success, the effect of
      the crippling wound ends. Once a creature has saved against a wound type,
      they are immune to that wound type for 24 hours.</p>
