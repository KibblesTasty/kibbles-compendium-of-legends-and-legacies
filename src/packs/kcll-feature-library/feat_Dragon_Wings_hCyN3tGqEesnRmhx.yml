    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 7th level, when you manifest your Draconic Talons, you can
      further channel your power to manifest a pair of draconic wings. Though
      they cannot lift you to flight, they provide a host of
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You can jump twice as far and change direction
      mid-jump by beating your wings.</li><li>You can slow your descent when
      falling (no action required), falling at 60 feet per round and taking no
      damage when you land.</li><li>As a reaction, you can expend an endurance
      die to block damage against a creature within 5 feet of you as if you were
      blocking damage against yourself.</li></ul>
