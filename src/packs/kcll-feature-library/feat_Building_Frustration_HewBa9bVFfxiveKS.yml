      <p>Starting at 10th level, if you miss an attack roll or fail a Strength
      saving throw or ability check while raging, you can add your Strength
      modifier to your next attempt to accomplish the same during that rage
      (attack the same creature, break the same object, save against the same
      spell). Failing a saving throw persists your rage until the end of your
      next turn if it would normally end.</p>
