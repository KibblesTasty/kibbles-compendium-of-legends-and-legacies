      <p>Starting at 14th level, you can cast Form of Fire, Form of Ice, or Form
      of Wind without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell this way,
      you can cast the spell as a bonus action, and it does not require
      concentration. Once per turn during the transformation, you can use the
      action it grants in place of an attack made as part of the Attack
      action.</p><p>Once you cast the ability in this way, you cannot do so
      again until you complete a long rest. You can use it again before
      completing a long rest by expending 6 endurance dice.</p>
