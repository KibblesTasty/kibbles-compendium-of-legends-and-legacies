      <p>Starting at 7th level, as a bonus action you can project your Primal
      Interdiction to be centered on a point within 60 feet instead of you. When
      you do so, the effects of difficult terrain and your abilities that take
      place inside your Primal Interdiction cover the area within range of the
      point rather than you. The aura returns to surrounding you if you move
      more than 60 feet from the point, or if you return it to you as a bonus
      action. You cannot recklessly defend your allies with your Primal
      Interdiction while it is projected at a point that does not also contain
      you within its radius.</p>
