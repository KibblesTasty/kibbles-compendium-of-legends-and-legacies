      <p>Your blood comes from a steadfast lineage, touched by the elemental
      forces of the earth itself. Be it the blood of ancient dwarves first
      formed from stone or from a dao lineage from another plane, your blood
      runs thicker and your heart beats more steady than others. While
      particularly common among the genasi and the dwarves, these sorcerers can
      appear in any bloodline with ancient roots.</p><p>Blessed with natural
      resilience and command over the stones on which they stand, most of these
      sorcerers are solid and deliberate in both action and thought. They are
      slow to act, but once set on a course they become stubborn and immovable
      from their chosen path.</p><hr /><p>The following are some optional quirks
      for a player of this Bloodline to choose
      from.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-tables.RollTable.vo5kfCLKiQtbxndJ
