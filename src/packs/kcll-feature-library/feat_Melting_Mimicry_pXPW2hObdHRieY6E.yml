    value: >-
      <p>You can absorb the corpse of a Medium or smaller creature, erasing all
      evidence of it. When you do so, you gain advantage on Charisma (Deception)
      checks to act to mimic that creature, and can perfectly recreate their
      features when disguising yourself as them with magic (such as alter self).
      At your DM’s discretion, you may be able to absorb limited memories or
      insights into the creature if it was recently deceased (potentially
      learning its name, minor insights into its final experiences, etc.).</p>
