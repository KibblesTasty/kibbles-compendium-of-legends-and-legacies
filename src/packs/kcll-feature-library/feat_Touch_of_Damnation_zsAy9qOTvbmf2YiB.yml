      <p>Starting at 1st level, your power carries a corrupting influence you
      can focus to weaken those that stand against you. As a reaction to a
      creature you can see within 30 feet making an attack roll or saving throw,
      you can bestow misfortune on them, rolling 1d6 and subtracting it from the
      total, possibly changing the outcome.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you
      can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
