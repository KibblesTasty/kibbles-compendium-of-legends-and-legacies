    value: >-
      <p>You open a pit filled with acid at a point within range. Each creature
      within 10 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
      failure, it falls 5 feet into a pit of acid below, taking 6d4 + 6 acid
      damage. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage from the
      flooding acid and can use its reaction to move up to its movement speed to
      the closest point outside of the area. If it cannot take a reaction or
      reach a safe space, it automatically fails its saving throw.</p><p> When a
      creature ends its turn in the pit, it takes 2d4 acid damage. The acid in
      the pit remains potent for 1 minute, after which it turns to vile sludge
      that deals no further damage. The pit remains filled with sludge until
      filled or cleared.</p>
