    value: >-
      <p>You create a line of low brambles that erupts from a space on the
      ground you can see within range. This line is 30 feet long and 5 feet
      wide, made up of six 5-foot squares of brambles. Each patch must connect
      to another patch and be placed on the ground. The bramble patches are
      difficult terrain and any creature entering a square of brambles takes 4d4
      piercing damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure,
      its speed becomes 0 until the end of its turn. </p><p>The brambles wither
      and die after 1 day if the area isnâ€™t suitable for them to grow. A
      creature can clear a 5-foot square with 1 minute of labor, or instantly by
      inflicting at least 5 points of fire damage. The brambles crumble to dust
      immediately if you cast this spell again. </p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level
      or higher, you can create two additional 5-foot squares of brambles for
      each slot level above 3rd.</p>
