    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, a steed and rider can coordinate to prevent the other
      from falling while they remain. If the steed or its rider would take
      damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it can instead be reduced to
      1 hit point and transfer any additional damage to the other (no action
      required), as long as both creatures are willing. Damage that would reduce
      the rider or steed to 0 hit points cannot be transferred in this way</p>
