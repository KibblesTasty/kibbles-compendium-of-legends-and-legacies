    value: >-
      <p>You cause a shield of ice to erupt and block the triggering attack. The
      attack's damage is reduced by 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier. If the
      attack damage is not completely blocked, the shield shatters, dealing the
      amount of blocked damage as cold damage to the attacker. If the shield is
      not broken, it melts away after blocking the damage.</p><p><strong>At
      Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd
      level or higher, the amount of damage blocked increases by 1d8 for each
      slot level above 2nd.</p>
