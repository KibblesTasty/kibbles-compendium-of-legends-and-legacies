      <p>Starting at 17th level, when you would manifest your Draconic Talons,
      you can instead completely turn into a dragon. You gain the benefits of
      your Draconic Talons and Dragon Wings, but with the following
      properties:</p><ul><li><strong>Large Size.</strong> Your size becomes
      Large, and you gain advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to grapple
      creatures smaller than you.</li><li><strong>Empowered Dragon
      Breath.</strong> When you use your Dragon Breath, you roll twice the
      number of stored dice for damage.</li><li><strong>Extra Natural
      Weapons.</strong> You gain a Bite and Tail attack, which are natural
      weapons like your Draconic Claws and deal the same amount of damage, but
      change their damage type and replace their special property. The Bite
      deals piercing damage instead of slashing damage and gains an additional
      1d8 elemental damage (matching your Dragon Breath damage type) in place of
      the special property, and the Tail deals bludgeoning damage instead of
      piercing damage and gains the reach property in place of the special
      property.</li><li><strong>Empowered Weapons.</strong> Your natural weapons
      deal one additional die of damage while transformed this
      way.</li><li><strong>Dragon Dread.</strong> Creatures frightened by your
      Intimidating Interdiction become frightened for 1 minute instead.
      Frightened creatures can repeat the saving throw against the frightened
      condition at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on
      success.</li></ul><p>You can maintain this form for up to 10 minutes,
      after which you must return to your normal form. You return to your
      original form early if you fall unconscious, or you can end the form early
      as an action. Once you assume this form, you cannot assume it again until
      you complete a long rest.</p>
