      <p>You have mastered a special connection to water and can beckon it to
      your call. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability
      Score Bonus.</strong> Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom ability
      score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Water Walker.</strong> You
      can walk on top of surfaces made of water as if they are solid
      ground.</li><li>You gain the Water Whip special attack
      (below).</li></ul><h5 id="water-whip">Water Whip</h5><p><em>Active Ability
      (Attack, Supernatural)</em></p><p>When you take the Attack action on your
      turn, you can replace one of your attacks with creating and using a whip
      of water. You can slam this into a creature within 30 feet of you, forcing
      it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes a
      number of d8 damage equal to your proficiency bonus, and is knocked 10
      feet in a direction of your choice (including straight up, if you so
      choose). On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and
      isn’t moved.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again
      until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
