    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in improvised weapons. Improvised
      weapons that do not otherwise use the stats of a weapon deal 1d8
      bludgeoning damage (instead of 1d4 damage) as long as they weigh more than
      20 pounds.</p><p> Additionally, you can make Strength ability checks
      against objects that would normally take an action as an object
      interaction (such as attempting to break down a door, smash a table, or
      break free of restraints).</p>
