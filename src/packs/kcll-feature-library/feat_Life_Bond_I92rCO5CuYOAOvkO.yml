    value: >-
      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, once per turn, when a creature within range
      of your Primal Interdiction takes damage, you can give one (or more if
      multiple creatures take damage at the same time) resistance to the damage
      taken (no action required). When you do so, you take the same amount of
      damage (after the resistance is applied).</p>
