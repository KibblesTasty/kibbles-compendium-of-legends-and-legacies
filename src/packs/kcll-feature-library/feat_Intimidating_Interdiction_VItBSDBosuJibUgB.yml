      <p>Starting at 3rd level, your Primal Interdiction sparks the primordial
      fear which dragons invoke in lesser creatures. As a bonus action, you can
      unleash a wave of supernatural dread, forcing all creatures of your choice
      within range of your Primal Interdiction to make a Wisdom saving throw
      with a DC of 8 + your Strength or Wisdom modifier (your choice) + your
      proficiency bonus.</p><p>On failure, a creature becomes
      &amp;Reference[Frightened] of you until the start of your next turn. On
      success, a creature does not become Frightened of you, but cannot gain
      advantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.
      Once a creature passes their saving throw against this ability, they
      automatically pass all saving throws against it for the next minute.</p>
