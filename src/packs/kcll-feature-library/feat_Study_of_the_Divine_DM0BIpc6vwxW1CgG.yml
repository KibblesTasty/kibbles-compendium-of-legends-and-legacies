    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you delve the secrets of the divine, prying
      into magic usually denied to the arcane paths. Whenever you gain a Wizard
      level, you can replace one of the Wizard spells you add to your spellbook
      with a spell from the Cleric spell list. Any Cleric spell you gain from
      this feature is considered a Wizard spell for you and is recorded in your
      spellbook, but other Wizards are unable to copy these spells into their
      own spellbooks. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell
      slots, and can never be a spell level higher than your proficiency bonus
      (meaning you will be unable to learn Cleric spells of 7th level or
      higher).</p><p>Your ability to recreate divine magic using arcane magics
      is limited. You can cast a number of spells gained from this feature equal
      to your proficiency bonus. You regain all uses when you complete a long
      rest. When you use your Arcane Recovery feature, you can choose to reset
      this limit instead of regain spell slots. Using divine magic that brings
      creatures back from the dead strains your body, causing you to gain 2
      levels of exhaustion when you cast a spell learned through this feature
      that restores a creature to life.</p>
