      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you can choose to master a weapon that would
      not normally be a monk weapon. Choose a simple or martial melee weapon
      that lacks the heavy and special properties. You gain proficiency in the
      weapon, and it becomes a monk weapon for you. You can choose another
      weapon in this way at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>
