      <p>At 20th level, your mastery of ritual and tradition is extensive and
      unparalleled; you’ve unlocked ancient secrets and perfected techniques to
      master rituals completely. Any Occultist spell you know of 3rd level or
      lower becomes a ritual spell for you. When you cast a spell without the
      ritual tag as a ritual, it requires additional consumed material
      components worth 10 gold per level of the spell.</p><p> Additionally, your
      mastery of rituals allows you to work them more quickly. A spell cast as a
      ritual only takes additional turns equal to the spell’s level to cast (for
      example, casting a 3rd level spell as a ritual would take four turns to
      cast, casting as your action or bonus action on the fourth turn). Spells
      with a casting time of a reaction cannot be cast as a ritual.</p>
