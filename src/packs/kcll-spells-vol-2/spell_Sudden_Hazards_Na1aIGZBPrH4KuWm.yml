    value: >-
      <p>You cause illusions of deadly traps or other hazards to spring up,
      filling a 60 foot cube originating from you. Swinging blades, lava flows,
      or other phantom hazards fill the minds of each creature of your choice
      within the area. An affected creature can move at half speed to evade the
      dangers, or move at its normal speed and take 1d8 psychic damage for each
      5 feet it moves within the area. Any affected creature ending its turn in
      the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 5d8 psychic damage
      on a failure or half as much on a success.</p><p> Each time a creature
      ends its turn in the area, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
      success, it realizes the traps are fake, and the spell ends for that
      creature.</p>
