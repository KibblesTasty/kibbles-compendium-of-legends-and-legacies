      <p>You learn the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.JVhKeanAXZH62DrF]{Warding Bond}
      spell. It is an Occultist spell for you, but does not count against your
      spells known.</p>

      <p>When you cast warding bond you can choose to increase the power of the
      bond. When you do so, if either bonded creature makes an Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, both creatures make the save. If either
      passes, both pass the save, but if both fail, both are affected by the
      condition being saved against, even if only one was targeted. If both
      creatures are saving against the same effect, they do not roll twice, but
      both pass if either passes their saving throws, and both fail if both fail
      their saving throw.</p>
