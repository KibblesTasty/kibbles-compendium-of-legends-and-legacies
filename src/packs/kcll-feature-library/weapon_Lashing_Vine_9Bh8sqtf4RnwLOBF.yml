      <p>A natural one handed melee weapon. Deals 1d6 slashing damage on hit,
      and has the Light, Reach, and Special Properties.</p><p>Special: This
      weapon has the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Grappling
      Weapon.</strong> When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can attempt
      to initiate a grapple against that creature as a bonus action. If you are
      grappling a creature with it, you can only use it to attack the creature
      it is grappling.</li><li><strong>Restraining Vines.</strong> You can make
      a grapple check with this weapon targeting a Large or smaller creature you
      are currently grappling with it. On success, the creature is restrained
      while grappled this way.</li><li><strong>Reaching Grapples.</strong> You
      can grapple creatures with this weapon with a reach equal to the weaponâ€™s
      reach. If a creature more than 5 feet away from you is grappled or
      restrained by you with this weapon their movement is not reduced to zero,
      but they can only move toward you. Once they are within 5 feet of you,
      their movement speed becomes zero.</li><li><strong>Grappling Larger
      Creatures.</strong> You can attempt to grapple creatures up to two sizes
      larger than you when initiating a grapple with this weapon, but creatures
      two sizes larger than you have their movement speed reduced by half,
      rather than reduced to zero. If they move out of range of your grapple,
      you can choose to release them, or be pulled along with their
      movement.</li></ul>
