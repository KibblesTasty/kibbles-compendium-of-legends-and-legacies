      <p>Starting at 18, you have survived so many dangerous situations and seen
      every trick in the book. At key moments, your intuition checks in. When
      you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you can replace
      the roll with your Fighter level. You can use this after you roll, but
      before you know the outcome. Once you do this, you cannot do so again
      until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
