      <p>Starting at 14th level, when you use your Void Gaze ability, you can
      create up to three spectral eyes at points within 60 feet of you, each of
      which last for 1 minute or until you dismiss them as a bonus action. Each
      eye projects a 30 foot cone in a direction of your choice. You can see
      through these eyes into their cones of vision as if you were seeing from
      your own eyes. When a creature starts its turn or enters into the gaze of
      these spectral eyes for the first time on their turn, you can subject them
      to the effect of your Void Gaze.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you
      cannot create spectral eyes in this way again until you complete a long
      rest.</p>
