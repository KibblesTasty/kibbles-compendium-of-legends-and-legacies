      <p>Starting at 14th level, when a creature ends their turn within range of
      your blindsight while you are raging, you can expend one focus die as a
      reaction to move toward that creature (up to your movement speed). If you
      can reach the creature after your movement, you can make one weapon attack
      against them as part of this reaction. This movement does not trigger
      opportunity attacks.</p>
