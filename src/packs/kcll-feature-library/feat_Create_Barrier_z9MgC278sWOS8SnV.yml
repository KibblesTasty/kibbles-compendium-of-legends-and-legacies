      <p>When you take the attack action on your turn, you can replace one of
      your attacks with manifesting an elemental barrier in an unoccupied space
      on the ground within 30 feet of you. This elemental barrier forms out of
      nearby materials (such as dirt, wood, or stone), and cannot be formed in
      the absence of natural materials. The barrier roughly blocks a 5 foot cube
      of space, and has an AC of 15, and hit points equal to 10 + your Warden
      level. You can have a number of these created equal to your proficiency
      bonus. When creating a new one beyond your limit, the oldest previously
      created one crumbles.</p><p>Based on your subclass, you may be able to
      create other kinds of barriers:</p><ul><li><strong>Astral
      Barrier.</strong> <em>(Prerequisite: Astral Guardian subclass)</em> The
      barrier does not require any nearby materials to form
      from.</li><li><strong>Ice Barrier.</strong> <em>(Prerequisite: Elemental
      Soul subclass)</em> The barrier does not require any nearby natural
      materials to form from, and deals 1d6 cold damage to any creature that
      attacks it.</li><li><strong>Iron Barrier.</strong> <em>(Prerequisite:
      Ironbound subclass)</em> The barrier has resistance to bludgeoning,
      piercing, and slashing damage.</li><li><strong>Tree Barrier.</strong>
      <em>(Prerequisite: Elderheart subclass)</em> The barrier does not require
      any nearby natural materials to form from, has hit points equal to 10 +
      twice your Warden level, and can form up to 20 feet
      tall.</li><li><strong>Stone Barrier.</strong> <em>(Prerequisite:
      Stoneblood subclass)</em> The barrier has an AC equal to your AC (unless
      it is already higher).</li></ul><p>You can create a total number of
      barriers equal to your Warden level before you must complete a short or
      long rest to more.</p>
