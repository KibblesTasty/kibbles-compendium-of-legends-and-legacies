      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can tactically assess a creature's options.
      As a bonus action, make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by
      a [[/check cha dec]] check against any creature you can see within 60
      feet.</p><p>On a success, you can see through their tactics, granting one
      of the following effects:</p><ul><li><strong>Determine Attack</strong>:
      You can cause them to have disadvantage on their next attack against a
      creature that can see or hear you.</li><li><strong>Predict
      Movement:</strong> You deduce where they are planning to move on their
      next turn. They can choose to change their plans, but if they move
      anywhere else, their movement speed is reduced by 10 feet as they scramble
      to adapt.</li><li><strong>Outwit Response:</strong> You can find their
      openings, negating their ability to use their reaction until the end of
      their next turn.</li><li><strong>Expose Weakness: </strong>You can use
      Helpful Word to grant advantage against that target as part of the bonus
      action without expending a Leadership Die.</li></ul>
