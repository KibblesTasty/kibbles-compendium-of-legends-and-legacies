    value: >-
      <p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a
      remarkable ability to turn anything into a weapon—fists, improvised
      weapons, goblins, etc. </p><p>You can add your proficiency bonus to
      attacks made with improvised weapons, and all attacks you make with them
      deal 1d8 damage bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (depending on
      their nature) if their damage die would be smaller. You can use creatures
      you are grappling as improvised weapons with the Thrown 5/10 property. If
      they are one or more sizes smaller than you, they gain the Light property.
      When you make an attack using a creature or object as a weapon, you can
      choose to deal damage equal to your Strength modifier to the creature or
      object you are using as a weapon.</p>
