      <p>An Outcast is a monk that has lost their Way. Trained in the basics of
      the style, they have abandoned the rigorous discipline and philosophy of
      their tradition, and are usually now enrolled only in the school of hard
      knocks.</p><p>Having been trained in the fundamentals of the art of ki,
      these monks choose as often as not to apply that art to tavern brawls and
      street fights. Much to the horror of many more formal monks, their rough
      and tumble lifestyle tends to be a solid source of further
      training.</p><p>With great power comes great responsibility? These monks
      are going to stick with just the great power, thank you very much. Almost
      always Chaotic, they can range the spectrum from Good to Evil and
      everything in between just as easily. A distaste for the rigorous
      philosophy of an order does not mean a penchant for Evil, but Evil and
      vice can sometimes lead a monk down this road.</p><hr /><p>The following
      are some optional quirks for a player of this Way to choose fromâ€”these can
      be either preexisting, signaling their fated path toward this Way, or
      appear after you commit yourself to this
      Way.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-tables.RollTable.UEhPnXlCTI5fL0sL
