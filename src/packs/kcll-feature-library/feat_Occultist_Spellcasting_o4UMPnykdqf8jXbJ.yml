      <p>As a practitioner of occult magic, you have inherited and developed
      techniques to manipulate reality through mediums of rituals, spirits,
      elements, and more. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting
      and the Spells Listing for the
      @UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-journals.JournalEntry.RJDtg9nL9x04U6gN.JournalEntryPage.70EIrE3H3ozC3wzU]{Occultist
      spell list}.</p><h2>Cantrips</h2><p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips
      of your choice from the Occultist spell list. You learn additional
      Occultist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the
      Cantrips Known column of the Occultist table.</p><h2>Spell
      Slots</h2><p>The Occultist table shows how many spell slots you have to
      cast your Occultist spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
      spells, you must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain
      all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example,
      if you know the 1st-level spell <em>lightning tendril</em> and have a
      1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <em>lightning
      tendril</em> using either slot.</p><h2>Spells Known of 1st Level and
      Higher</h2><p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the
      Occultist spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Occultist table
      shows when you learn more Occultist spells of your choice. Each of these
      spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the
      table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn
      one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a
      level in this class, you can choose one of the Occultist spells you know
      and replace it with another spell from the Occultist spell list, which
      also must be of a level for which you have spell
      slots.</p><h2>Spellcasting Ability</h2><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting
      ability for your Occultist spells. Your magic comes from a practitioner's
      knowledge of tradition, ritual, and the way things work learned through
      experience, care and cunning. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers
      to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier
      when setting the saving throw DC for an Occultist spell you cast and when
      making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 +
      your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.</p><p><strong>Spell attack
      modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
      modifier.</p><h2>Ritual Casting</h2><p>You can cast any Occultist spell
      you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p><h2>Spellcasting
      Focus</h2><p>You can use an
      @UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-items.Item.6q1U0Dcw2e8KTiJG]{occult
      fetish} as a spellcasting focus for your Occultist spells.</p>
