      <p>Starting at 1st level, when you roll initiative or as a bonus action at
      any time, you can manifest one or both of your arms into clawed natural
      weapons. You cannot wield weapons or shields in hands that you have
      morphed, but they can be used to grapple creatures. While you are
      grappling a creature with a claw, that claw can only attack that creature.
      The claws last until you dismiss them as a bonus
      action.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feature-library.Item.MEhAZsmw09neLany]{Bestial
