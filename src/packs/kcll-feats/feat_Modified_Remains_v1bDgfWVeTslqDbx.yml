      <p>You've found your remains to be somewhat... customizable. After all,
      what's the harm in swapping out a few parts here and there? You gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong>
      Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability score by 1, to
      a maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Skeleton Carving.</strong> You gain a
      natural weapon that deals 2d4 damage (piercing or slashing, your choice)
      or Increase your AC by 1. If you already have a natural weapon and select
      a natural weapon , you can increase the damage of your existing natural
      weapon by a d2 step instead (from a d6 to a d8, for example). If a natural
      weapon has multiple damage dice, increase only one this way.</li></ul>
