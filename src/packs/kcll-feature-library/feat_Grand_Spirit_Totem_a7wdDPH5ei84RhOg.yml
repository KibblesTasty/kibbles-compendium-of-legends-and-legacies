      <p>Starting at 14th level, as an action you can place a Medium sized grand
      totem on an empty space within 30 feet of you that attracts and binds a
      swarm of powerful malevolent spirits. It has the normal AC and hit points
      of your totems, but gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 5
      times your Wisdom modifier. If you have the Dancing Totems specialization,
      you can choose to make it a tiny sized object that orbits you as other
      totems do instead.</p><p>Any creature other than you that starts its turn
      or enters within 20 feet of the totem for the first time on their turn
      must make a Charisma saving throw. On failure, it is plagued by the
      spirits and subtracts your Malignant Possession die from all attack rolls,
      saving throws, or ability checks it makes for the full duration of the
      totem while within 20 feet of the totem. It is treated as if under the
      effect of Malignant Possession for rites and features that modify your
      Malignant Possession, but can take damage from Rotting Affliction only
      once per turn.</p><p>If a creature exits the range of the totem, it is no
      longer under the effect, but becomes automatically under the effect once
      more if it enters range of the totem (without getting to make another
      save). This effect only ends once the totemâ€™s effect ends, or the totem is
      destroyed. The totem lasts for 1 minute, and can be dismissed early as a
      bonus action, after which it crumbles to dust. </p><p>This totem does not
      consume a use of your Totem Binding feature, but once you invoke this
      totem, you cannot invoke it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
