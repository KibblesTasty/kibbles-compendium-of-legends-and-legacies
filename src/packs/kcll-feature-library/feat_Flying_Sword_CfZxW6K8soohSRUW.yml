    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, during a long rest you can touch a melee weapon,
      infusing it magical power. This Flying Sword can be carried or stowed like
      a normal weapon, or you can ready it, causing it to float beside you.
      While an Flying Sword is readied, you can make attacks with it as part the
      Attack action, sending it out to strike a target.</p><p>Attacks made with
      your Flying Sword are considered melee weapon attacks with the weapon, but
      you can use your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength or
      Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls, and you can make this
      attack against a target out to a range of 30 feet away from you. If the
      weapon has the heavy or special property, this range is halved to 15 feet;
      and if the weapon has the light property, this range is doubled to 60
      feet.</p><p>Spells infused into the flying weapon affect the target of the
      attack, but only have a range equal to the range of the spell. If you
      attack a target beyond the range of the spell, the spell fails and is
      lost.</p>
