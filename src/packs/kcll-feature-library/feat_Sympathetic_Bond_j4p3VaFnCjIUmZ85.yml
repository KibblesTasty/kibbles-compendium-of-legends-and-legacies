      <p>You learn the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.JVhKeanAXZH62DrF]{Warding Bond}
      spell. It is an Occultist spell for you, but does not count against your
      spells known.</p><p>When you cast warding bond, you can choose to increase
      the power of the bond. When you do so, if either bonded creature makes an
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, both creatures make the
      save. If either succeeds on the saving throw, both succeed, but if both
      fail, both are affected by the condition being saved against, even if only
      one was targeted. If both creatures are saving against the same effect,
      they do not roll twice, but both succeed if either succeeds on the saving
      throws and only fail if both fail the saving throw.</p>
