    value: >-
      <p>You choose a 10-foot square area on the ground in an area of dirt or
      natural stone you can see. The ground buckles and opens into a 10-foot
      deep pit. If the surface is not large enough to contain the pit, the spell
      fails. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
      success, a creature jumps to a space 5 feet outside the spell's radius. On
      a failure, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit (taking normal
      &amp;Reference[falling] damage). The sides of the pit are rough, and can
      be climbed. A creature that saves but cannot locate an empty space to move
      to falls &amp;Reference[prone], hanging from the edge of the pit, and
      cannot stand until it moves out of the pit area or drops into it. The pit
      remains until filled.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you
      cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the pit is 5
      feet deeper for each slot level above 1st, to a maximum of 20 feet
      deep.</p>
