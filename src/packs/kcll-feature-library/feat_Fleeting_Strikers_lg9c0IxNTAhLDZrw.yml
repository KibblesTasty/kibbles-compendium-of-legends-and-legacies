      <p>Starting at 11th level, if you are not in the same spot you were at the
      end of your last turn or are obscured from your target, the first attack
      you make during your turn deals an additional [[/damage 1d10]]
      damage.</p><p>Additionally, a creature that you grant an Attack with
      Battlefield Presence can take the Dash action instead of making the attack
      you granted.</p>
