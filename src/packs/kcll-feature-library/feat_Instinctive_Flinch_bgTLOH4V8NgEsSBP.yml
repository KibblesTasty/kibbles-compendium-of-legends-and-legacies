  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 15th level, when a creature passes a Wisdom saving throw
      against one of your features that would cause them to become frightened or
      flee, they still gain disadvantage on their next attack role made before
      the start of your next turn. This has no effect if the target is immune to
      the frightened condition.</p>
