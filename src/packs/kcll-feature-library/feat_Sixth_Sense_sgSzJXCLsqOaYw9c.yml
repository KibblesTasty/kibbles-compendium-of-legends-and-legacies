    value: >-
      <p>Additionally at 1st level, you gain a special sense allowing you to
      sense extraplanar energies. You can detect if you are being watched
      through magic or by creatures within 30 feet of you in the ethereal plane
      if your passive Perception is equal to or higher than 10 + their CR (or
      their spell save DC if they are using a spell to observe you).</p>
