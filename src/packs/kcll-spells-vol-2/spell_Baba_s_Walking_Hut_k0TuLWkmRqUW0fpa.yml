    value: >-
      <p>You touch a hut, cabin, or other building no more than 15 feet by 15
      feet by 10 feet. On completion of the spell, the building grows legs large
      enough to support it, as well as the structural integrity needed stand and
      move, and becomes a gargantuan creature. It has 250 hit points, an AC of
      12, and a walking speed of 20 feet. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell
      ends.</p><p>On your turn, you can direct it to move (no action required)
      and it will continue to move as directed until you direct it to stop or
      reaches its destination. It can take no actions, but if it walks over a
      Large or smaller creature, you can direct it to attempt to step on that
      creature, and that creature must succeed a Dexterity saving throw, or take
      2d10 bludgeoning damage and be knocked &amp;Reference[prone].</p><p>If you
      cast this spell on the same building every day for a year, the spell lasts
      until dispelled, or you cast it on another building.</p>
