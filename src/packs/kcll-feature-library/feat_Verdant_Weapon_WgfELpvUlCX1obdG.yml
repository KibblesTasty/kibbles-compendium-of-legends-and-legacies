      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you learn the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.VzgFzcmocr1X1cp4]{Shillelagh} cantrip. You
      can target any weapon with it, but when targeting a weapon other than a
      club, quarterstaff, or greatclub, its effect does not change the damage
      dice. When you target a greatclub, the damage dice becomes 1d12.</p>
