    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, each time you expend an Endurance Die you build
      up elemental energy, storing the expended die in a special pool of charged
      power for 1 minute. You can have a number of stored dice equal to your
      proficiency bonus. As a bonus action on your turn, you can unleash all of
      this stored power in a blast of elemental breath. You expend all dice
      stored with this feature when you do so. When you gain this feature,
      select the elemental type of power stored from acid, cold, fire,
      lightning, or poison.</p><p> All creatures of your choice within a 15-foot
      cone must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 8 + your Strength or
      Wisdom modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save,
      they take elemental damage of the type selected equal to the amount rolled
      on the stored dice. On a successful save, they take half as much damage.
      The size of the cone increases by 15 feet each time your Primal
      Interdiction range increases by 5 feet.</p>
