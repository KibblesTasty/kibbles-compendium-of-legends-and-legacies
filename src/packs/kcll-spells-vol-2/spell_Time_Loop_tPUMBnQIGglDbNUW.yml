  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You force a creature within range to repeat its last turn. The target
      must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have its personal timeline
      adjusted so that it repeats its last action in a preordained loop on its
      next turn. As the rest of the world may have changed, it attempts to
      repeat its last action to the best of its ability, including moving the
      same distance in the same direction, attacking the same target, or taking
      the same action.</p><p>If the target's attempts to repeat its turn
      conflict, the caster decides which part of the turn takes precedence.
      While a creature is compelled to repeat its turn, it cannot be compelled
      to move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a
      pit.</p><blockquote><h5>Note Taking </h5><p>Unlike most material
      components, for convenience sake, this spell’s material components is
      required by the player in addition to their character (whose detailed list
      does not need to by a physical object, simply the knowledge of their
      target’s actions), and consequently requires some preparation and
      attention to detail on the player’s part to avoid making the DM having to
      keep track of such details.</p></blockquote>
