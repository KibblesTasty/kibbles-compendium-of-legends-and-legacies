    value: >-
      <p>When you take damage as part casting blood magic (from contributing the
      material component or through the Hemomancer feat) it does not force a
      saving throw to maintain concentration if you are concentrating on a
      spell.</p><p> Additionally, when you expend hit points casting a spell
      with blood magic, you gain temporary hit points equal to the hit points
      expended on its material components.</p>
