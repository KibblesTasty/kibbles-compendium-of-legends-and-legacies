    value: >-
      <p>When a target is compelled to move by an Occultist spell you cast, you
      can pick the direction the target moves, even if you would normally not be
      able to (for example, a spell that causes the target to run away from you
      can be used to make the target run in any direction). This does not change
      a targetâ€™s willingness to enter hazardous spaces.</p>
