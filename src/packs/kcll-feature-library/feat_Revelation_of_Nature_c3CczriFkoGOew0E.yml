    value: >-
      <p>When you cast a 1st level spell or higher that creates difficult
      terrain, you can force one creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On
      failure, if the creature is within the area of the spell creates difficult
      terrain, its movement speed is reduced to zero. If it is outside the area
      of difficult terrain, its movement speed is reduced by half.</p>
