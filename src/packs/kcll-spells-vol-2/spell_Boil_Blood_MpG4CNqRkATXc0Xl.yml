    value: >-
      <p>You point at a creature that has taken slashing or piercing damage
      within the last minute and make its blood heat to boiling. The target must
      succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its blood overheats. At the
      start of each of its turns, it takes 3d4 fire damage and is crippled with
      agony, turning all terrain into difficult terrain for it.</p><p>At the end
      of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving
      throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level
      or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
