    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 10th level, your spiritâ€™s ability to share your senses
      allows it to forewarn and assist you. You gain proficiency in the
      Perception skill. If you are already proficient, you gain expertise in the
      Perception skill, meaning you can add twice your proficiency bonus to
      Perception ability checks.</p><p> Additionally, this heightened awareness
      gives you proficiency with Dexterity saving throws against effects you can
      see.</p>
