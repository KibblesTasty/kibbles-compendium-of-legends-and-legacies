    value: >-
      <p>At 18th level, as a bonus action you can create an illusory duplicate
      of yourself at a point within 30 feet. The duplicateâ€™s AC equals 10 + your
      Dexterity modifier, and if targeted with an effect that forces a save, it
      uses your saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate or it fails a
      saving throw that would cause it to take damage the duplicate is
      destroyed. It ignores all other damage and effects, but an effect that
      would otherwise cause it to take damage reveals it to be a duplicate. The
      duplicate mimics your action and is indistinguishable from you until you
      attack, cast a spell, or take damage. The duplicate looks real even to
      creatures with blindsight or truesight.</p><p>When you create the
      duplicate, you can expend 2 sorcery points to create an additional
      duplicate, creating up to 3 duplicates.</p><p>At the end of each of your
      turns while a duplicate exists, you can switch places with any active
      duplicate within 120 feet, leaving no trace of which one is real until you
      attack, cast a spell, or take damage.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you
      cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest. You can use
      it again early by expending 2 sorcery points.</p>
