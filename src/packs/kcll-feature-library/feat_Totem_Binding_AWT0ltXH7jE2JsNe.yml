      <p>Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you can create a totem of power at
      a point within 15 feet of you. You learn two totems when you gain this
      feature, and another totem at 5th level (3), 11th level (4), and 17th
      level (5). The following are the list of totems you can
      select:</p><ul><li><p>@UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feature-library.Item.9kQqZa7H8ujnitX1]{Agonizing

      and hit points equal to your occultist level ([[lookup
      @classes.occultist.levels]]). If it is reduced to 0 hit points, it is
      destroyed and its effect ends. A creature cannot be affected by more than
      one of the same type of totem at the same time. A totem cannot be moved
      once placed. Totems can last a maximum of 1 minute, after which they lose
      power and crumble away. You can place a number of totems equal to your
      Wisdom modifier, regaining all uses when you complete a long rest.</p>
