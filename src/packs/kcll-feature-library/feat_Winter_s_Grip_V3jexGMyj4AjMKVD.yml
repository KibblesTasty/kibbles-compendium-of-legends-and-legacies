      <p>Starting at 15th level, the effect of Frostbite is prolonged each time
      a creature takes cold damage by an additional round (ending at the end of
      your next turn). Additionally, when a creature under the effect of
      Frostbite fails a saving throw against one of your spells that deal cold
      damage, they become &amp;Reference[restrained] until start of their next
      turn.</p>
