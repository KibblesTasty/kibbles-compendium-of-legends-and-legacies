    value: >-
      <p>You lighten your own steps with a spell of effortless quickness. For
      the duration of the spell, your movement does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity. When another creature you can see or hear ends its turn, you
      can move up to 10 feet (no action required). You can move in this way up
      to 4 times, regaining all uses at the start of your next turn. The first
      attack against you after each movement is made at
      disadvantage.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this
      spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of times you
      can move at the end of another creature’s turn increases by 1 for each
      slot level above 4th.</p>
