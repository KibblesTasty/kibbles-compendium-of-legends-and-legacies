      <p><em>(Prerequisite: 5th level Hedge Mage)</em></p><p>You learn one
      Metamagic option of your choice from the Sorcerer class. You can use this
      Metamagic option once, regaining the ability to use it again after
      completing a long rest. When using it this way, you use it as if you
      expended 3 or less sorcery points. </p><p>You can use it again before
      completing a long rest by expending a spell slot of a level equal to the
      number of sorcery points the Metamagic would cost to use.</p>
