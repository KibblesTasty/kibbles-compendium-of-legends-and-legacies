    value: >-
      <p>You touch a piece of ammunition or a weapon with the thrown property,
      imbuing it with crackling lightning for the duration.</p><p>The first time
      you attack with the empowered item, it transforms into a bolt of
      lightning, blasting out from you in a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide.
      Make one weapon attack, applying the result against every creature in the
      line. This attack deals 4d8 lightning damage on a hit, and half as much
      damage on a miss. This damage roll doesn't add any modifiers or bonuses
      associated with weapon attacks. The lightning ignites flammable objects in
      the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.</p><p>Once an attack has been
      made with the piece of ammunition or weapon, the spell
      ends.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for
      each level above 3rd, up to a maximum of 6d8 at 5th level.</p>
