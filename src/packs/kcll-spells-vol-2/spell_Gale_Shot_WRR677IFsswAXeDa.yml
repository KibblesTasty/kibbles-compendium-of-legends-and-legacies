    value: >-
      <p>You touch a piece of ammunition or weapon with the thrown property,
      imbuing it with the power of a hurricane for the duration. The first time
      you attack with the empowered item, it is propelled with hurricane force.
      On a hit, the target takes an additional 4d8 damage from the attack and is
      knocked backwards 30 feet. Any creature the target collides with takes 2d8
      bludgeoning damage. On a miss, the target takes half as much damage and is
      not knocked back.</p><p>Once an attack has been made with the piece of
      ammunition or weapon, the spell ends.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level,
      the shot deals an additional 1d8 damage and the target is knocked
      backwards an additional 10 feet. </p>
