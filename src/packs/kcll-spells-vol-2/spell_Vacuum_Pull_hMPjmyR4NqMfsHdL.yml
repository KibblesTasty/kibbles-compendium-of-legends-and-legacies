    value: >-
      <p>You create a howling blast of wind, attempting to pull a Huge or
      smaller creature that you can see within range toward you. The target must
      succeed a Strength saving throw or be yanked off its feet and pulled to
      you, landing within 5 feet of you and falling &amp;Reference[prone].
      Flying creatures make this save at disadvantage.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell lot of 3rd level
      or higher, the range of the spell increases by 10 feet.</p>
