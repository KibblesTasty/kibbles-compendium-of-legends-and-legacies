    value: >-
      <p>You create a small gust within range, causing the air to surge and
      swirl to your command. Select one of the following effects:</p><ul><li>The
      next ranged weapon attack against a creature of your choice within range
      has disadvantage.</li><li>One Large or smaller creature of your choice
      within range must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet
      or knocked &amp;Reference[prone] (your choice).</li><li>You can increase
      the next jump made by a creature of your choice within range by 5
      feet.</li><li>You manipulate the wind in a minor way, such as pushing a
      light object up to 10 feet, rustling plants, slamming a door, or similar
      effects. These arenâ€™t powerful enough to move creatures or deal
      damage.</li></ul>
