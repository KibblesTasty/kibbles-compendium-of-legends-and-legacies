      <p>A small cyclone whips up at a point you can see on the ground within
      range. The cyclone is a 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on
      that point. </p><p>Any creature that starts its turn within the radius of
      the dust cyclone or enters its radius for the first time during its turn
      must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
      1d12 bludgeoning damage is pushed 5 feet away from the center. On a
      successful save, the creature takes half as much damage isn’t pushed.
      </p><p>As a bonus action, you can move the dust cyclone up 30 feet in any
      direction. The first time you pass the dust cyclone’s radius through a
      creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the dust
      cyclone’s damage and are pushed out its way on failure. You can continue
      to move the dust cyclone, but its strength is exhausted until the end of
      your turn and subsequent creatures an unaffected by it passing through
      them. </p><p>If the dust cyclone moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or
      small gravel, it sucks up the material and heavily obscures its radius
      until the start of your next turn.</p>
