      <p>Starting at 14th level, you can build off the success of others and
      encourage them to greater heights. When another creature scores a critical
      hit while within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a
      single weapon attack against the same target. </p><p>When you deal a
      critical hit or a creature fails a saving throw against one of your spells
      by 5 or more, you can use your reaction to take the Help action to
      encourage an ally to follow up on success. </p><p>You can expend a use of
      Bardic Inspiration to take one of these reactions on any hit or failed
      save, even when the attack was not a critical hit.</p>
