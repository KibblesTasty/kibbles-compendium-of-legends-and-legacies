      <p><em>(Prerequisite: Zealous Conviction, 12th level
      Cultist)</em></p><p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can make a
      Spellcasting ability check with a DC of 5 + the damage taken. On success,
      you are reduced to 1 hit point instead.</p><p>On failure, you can expend a
      spell slot to increase the value rolled by an amount equal to the level of
      the spell slot, potentially during a failure into a success. Once you
      spend a spell slot to do so, you cannot do so against until you complete a
      short or long rest.</p>
