      <p>You can no longer choose which option to use with your Void Gaze, but
      roll randomly to determine the effect. In exchange, the effect gains
      additional die of temporary hit points or damage (for example, Conclusion
      of Annihilation would deal 2d8 force damage). You can pick the target
      after rolling for the effect.</p>
