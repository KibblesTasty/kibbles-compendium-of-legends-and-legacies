  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, the doggo gains the ability to use ferocious barks to
      disrupt mind-influencing effects. As a reaction to any creature within 30
      feet of you making a saving throw against being frightened or charmed, you
      can bark loudly bringing to them back to their senses giving. All
      creatures within 30 feet gain advantage on saving throws against being
      charmed or frightened until the start of your next turn. A creature must
      be able to hear you to gain this benefit.</p>
