      <p>Your relentless practice with a bow grants you the following benefits
      while using one:</p><ul><li><strong>Ranging Shots.</strong> When you miss
      a ranged weapon attack with a bow, your next ranged weapon attack roll
      with a bow has advantage.</li><li><strong>Overwatch.</strong> As a bonus
      action, you can ready a shot until the start of your next turn. If a
      creature moves 5 feet or more while within 30 feet of you while you have a
      shot readied, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack
      against that creature with a −5 penalty to the attack roll.</li></ul>
