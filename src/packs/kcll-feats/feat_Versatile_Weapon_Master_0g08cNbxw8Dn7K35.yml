      <p>You are an expert on the fluid use of versatile weapons, changing
      stances to fit any situation. When you draw a versatile weapon you are
      proficient with, or start your turn while wielding one, you can enter a
      special stance as long as you aren’t wielding other weapons or a shield.
      This lasts until the start of your next turn, drop or sheath your weapon,
      or equip a shield. Each stance provides modifiers to your melee weapon
      attacks made with the versatile weapon while in that
      stance:</p><ul><li><strong>Neutral Stance.</strong> You add +1 to your
      attack rolls, damage rolls, and armor class.</li><li><strong>Power
      Stance.</strong> You don’t add your Proficiency bonus to attack rolls, but
      add twice your Proficiency bonus to your damage
      rolls.</li><li><strong>Accuracy Stance.</strong> You add twice your
      Proficiency bonus to attack rolls (instead of just your Proficiency Bonus,
      but don’t add your ability modifier to damage
      rolls.</li><li><strong>Defensive Stance.</strong> You don’t add your
      Proficiency bonus to attack rolls, but if you hit at least one attack
      against a hostile creature, you can add your proficiency bonus to your AC
      until the start of your next turn.</li></ul>
