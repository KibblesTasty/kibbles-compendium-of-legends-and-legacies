    value: >-
      <p>You grasp that looking into the light blinds as surely as looking away
      from it. When you cast <em>prismatic flash</em> or a 1st level spell or
      higher spell that sheds 5 feet or more of bright light, as a bonus action
      you can force one creature within 30 feet of the light to make a Dexterity
      saving throw, or become &amp;Reference[blinded] until the start of your
      next turn.</p><p>A creature is unaffected by this effect if it canâ€™t see,
      if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can
      perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.</p>
