    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you activate a Revelation, you gain
      temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. Additionally, you can
      trigger a Revelation when you cast a 1st level spell that otherwise
      doesn't fit its requirements (for example, triggering Revelation of Fire
      on a spell that doesn't deal fire damage)</p>
