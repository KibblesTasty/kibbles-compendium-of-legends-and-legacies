      <p>You master the reckless rush of smashing into the enemy line. You gain
      the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a
      maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Heavy Momentum.</strong> If you move at
      least 20 feet in a direction before making your first melee weapon attack
      roll on your turn, the attack deals an additional 1d8 damage.</li><li>Gain
      the Wild Charge special attack (below).</li></ul><h5 id="wild-charge">Wild
      Charge</h5><p><em>Active Ability (Attack)</em></p><p>When you take the
      Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with
      making a charge. You or a mount you are controlling can move up to 30 feet
      in a straight line, flinging your enemies out of your path.</p><p>This
      movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Large or smaller
      creatures in your path must make a Strength saving throw, or be knocked
      out of your way and prone. If a creature has no where they can move, they
      are knocked prone but not moved, and you pass over them. A creature takes
      2d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage on a failed save. The
      number of d6 increases by one when your proficiency bonus increases (with
      the total number of d6 equaling your proficiency bonus). Your charge ends
      early if a creature passes their save. Creatures with a CR equal to less
      than half of your character level automatically fail their
      save.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you
      complete a short or long rest.</p>
