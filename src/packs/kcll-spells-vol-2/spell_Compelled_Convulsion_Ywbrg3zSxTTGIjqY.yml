    value: >-
      <p>You attempt to briefly take control of the blood of a creature you can
      see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
      failure, you can force it to use its reaction to move up to 15 feet (or
      its movement speed, whichever is less) and make a single weapon attack
      against a target of your choice within reach. Creatures without blood are
      immune to this effect.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you
      cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target
      an additional creature for each level above 2nd level.<br /></p>
