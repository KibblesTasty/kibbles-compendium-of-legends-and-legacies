    value: >-
      <p>You twist illusions around a melee weapon you are holding. When you
      cast the spell, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns for the
      duration, you can feint with the illusory blades, distracting a creature
      within 5 feet of you and giving you advantage on the next weapon attack
      against it before the end of the turn. The spell ends early if you let go
      of the weapon.</p><p> As an action, a creature that can see you can make
      an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. On a
      success, it becomes immune to the spell's effects.</p>
