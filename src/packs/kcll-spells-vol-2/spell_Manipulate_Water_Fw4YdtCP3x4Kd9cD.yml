    value: >-
      <p>You shape water you can see within range, causing it to move at to your
      command. Select one of the following effects:</p><ul><li>You can move or
      direct the flow of a 5-foot cube of water in a direction of your choice,
      but the water will revert back to its natural flow at the start of your
      next turn unless you concentrate on keeping it in place.</li><li>You can
      mold the water into small shapes or simple animations. This change lasts
      for 1 minute.</li><li>You can change the color or opacity of a 5-foot cube
      of water. This change lasts for 1 hour.</li><li>You can freeze up to a
      5-foot cube of unoccupied water or thaw up to a 5-foot cube of ice. The
      water unfreezes or refreezes naturally based on the environmental
      conditions (usually taking an hour or more to completely melt or freeze
      unless in extreme conditions).</li></ul>
