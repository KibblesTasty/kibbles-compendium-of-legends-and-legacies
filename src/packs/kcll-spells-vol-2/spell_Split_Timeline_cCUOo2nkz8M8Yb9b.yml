    value: >-
      <p>You choose a willing creature in range and split its timeline in two.
      At the start of that creatureâ€™s next turn, a temporal duplicate of them
      appears in a space adjacent to it. The duplicate lasts until the end of
      the target's turn or it drops to 0 hit points (whichever comes first).
      Their temporal duplicate shares the target's statistics, abilities, and
      resources, and is under the target's control. Any abilities, items, or
      spells with limited uses deplete the equivalent resources for the
      target.</p><p> At the end of the target's turn, the temporal duplicate
      disappears. </p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this
      spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the temporal duplicate
      lasts for 1 additional round for each slot level above 4th.</p>
