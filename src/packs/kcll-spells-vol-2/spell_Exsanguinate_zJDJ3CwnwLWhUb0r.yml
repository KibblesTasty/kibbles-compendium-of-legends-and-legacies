    value: >-
      <p>You drain a creature of blood, tearing its vital energy away. The
      target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its current
      and maximum hit points are reduced by 6d6. On a success, its current hit
      points are reduced by half as much, and its maximum hit points are not
      reduced. If the target was below half its maximum hit points before the
      spell was cast, its current hit points are reduced by an additional 6d6
      hit points, regardless of the save result. </p><p>Any maximum hit point
      reduction caused by this spell lasts until the target finishes a long rest
      or is targeted with greater restoration. A creature without blood is
      immune to this spell.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you
      cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the hit point
      reduction on a failed saving throw is increased by 1d6 for each level over
      4th.<br /></p>
