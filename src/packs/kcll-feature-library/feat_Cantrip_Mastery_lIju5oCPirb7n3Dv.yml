    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, you can cast an Occultist cantrip with a
      casting time of one action as a bonus action. When you cast a cantrip in
      this way, it is cast as if you are a 1st level
      caster.</p><blockquote><h5>Bonus Action Casting</h5><p>This does not
      remove the restrictions around bonus action spells, meaning that when you
      do this, you cannot cast a leveled spell with your action, but can cast 2
      cantrips. This works particularly well with non-scaling cantrips that do
      things beside damage, such as provide defenses or
      utility.</p></blockquote>
