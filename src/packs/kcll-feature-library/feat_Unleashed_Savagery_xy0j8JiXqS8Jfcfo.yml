      <p>Starting at 6th level, once during a rage, as an attack as part of the
      Attack action, you can unleash your rage into pure energy, exhaling a
      blast of elemental power. Creatures within 15 foot cone must make a
      Dexterity saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your
      proficiency modifier + your strength modifier. A creature takes 6d6 damage
      of the Elemental Type of your Dragon Color on a failed save. </p><p>The
      damage and range of this breath weapon increases at 10th level (to 8d6 in
      a 30 foot cone), at 14th level (10d6 in a 45 foot cone), and at 18th level
      (12d6 in a 60 foot cone)</p>
