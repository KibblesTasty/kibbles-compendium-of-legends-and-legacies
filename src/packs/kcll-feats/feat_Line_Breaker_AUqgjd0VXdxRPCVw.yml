      Strength or Constitution by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Heavy
      Impacts.</strong> When you push a creature, if the creature's movement is
      stopped early by another creature, object, or terrain, they take 1d4
      bludgeoning damage for each 5 feet moved before the
      collision.</li><li>Gain the Might Impact special attack

      Ability (Attack)</em></p><p>When you take the Attack action on your turn,
      you can replace one of your attacks to slam an enemy backwards. The target
      must make a Strength saving throw. On failure, it takes 2d6 + your
      Strength modifier damage and is pushed 15 feet away from you. On a
      success, it takes half as much damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.
      The distance the target is pushed is reduced by 5 feet for every size
      larger than you it is. The number of d6 increases by one when your
      proficiency bonus increases (with the total number of d6 equaling your
      proficiency bonus).</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it
      again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
