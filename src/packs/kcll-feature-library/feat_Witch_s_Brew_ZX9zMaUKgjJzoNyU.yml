    value: >-
      <p>During a short or long rest, you can infuse a spell with a casting time
      of one action or bonus action into a concoction, expending the spell slot
      on completion of the rest.</p>

      <p>This spell can subsequently be cast by anyone carrying the potion by
      drinking the potion as an action, with the drinker as the target, acting
      as the caster of the spell, but using the Witch's spell casting ability
      modifier.</p>

      <p>The potion remains potent until you complete a long rest and recharge
      the spell slot expended to create the potion.</p>
