    value: >-
      <p>You gain the ability to infuse your weapon with the power granted to
      you by the spirits. While you have an empowered spirit bonded, as a bonus
      action you can pour all of its energy into your weapon (recalling it if it
      is manifested). The next attack with that weapon adds twice the additional
      damage from the spirit, but the bond immediately expires.</p>
