      <p>Starting at 14th level, your influence on the minds of others you have
      charmed causes strengthens your167 influence. When a creature starts their
      turn charmed by you, you can force them to make a Wisdom saving throw
      against your Warlock spell save DC, or move up to their movement speed
      where you direct. This cannot make them move into hazardous terrain, and
      if they take damage during the movement, the movement ends and they regain
      control.</p>
