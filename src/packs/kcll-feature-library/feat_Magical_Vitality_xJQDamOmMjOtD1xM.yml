      <p>As you are powered by magic, your vitality can be restored by magical
      power. Any creature (including you) with access to spell slots can expend
      a spell slot as an action with a range of touch to restore 1d8 + their
      spell casting modifier hit points donating their magical power to your
      vitality. The amount restored increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level
      above 1st. Whenever you are healed in this fashion, you can expend hit
      dice (rolling them as normal) equal to the spell slot level used to regain
      additional hit points.</p><p>Additionally, you can be returned to life
      with the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.oyE5nVppa5mde5gT]{animate
      dead} spell, which has the effects of
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{revivify} when cast
      targeting only you.</p>
