    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 18th level, manifesting or changing the form of your Spirit
      Weapon no longer requires a bonus action. You can cause it to take any
      form it could normally take at will during your turn, no action required.
      Once per turn, when manifesting the weapon or changing the form of your
      weapon, you can gain advantage on the next attack you make before the end
      of your turn.</p>
