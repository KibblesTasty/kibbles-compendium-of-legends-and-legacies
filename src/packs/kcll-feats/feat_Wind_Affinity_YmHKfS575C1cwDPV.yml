    value: >-
      <p>You are touched by the winds, either from a blessing of a powerful
      entity or through focused mastery and study of their essence, allowing you
      to borrow and harness their power.</p><p> You learn the windborne weapon
      and manipulate wind cantrips and the become wind spell. You can cast it
      innately without expending a spell slot once, regaining the ability to so
      when you complete a short or long rest. When you cast it this way, you
      cast it a level equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
