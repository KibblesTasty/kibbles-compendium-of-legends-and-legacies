    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you excel at tracking prey even if they take
      refuge in the trappings of civilization. When you make an Intelligence or
      Wisdom check related to tracking a creature in cities or towns, your
      proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re
      proficient in. You can only gain this benefit if you are familiar with the
      target’s race or general appearance (such as a sketch from a wanted
      poster).</p>
