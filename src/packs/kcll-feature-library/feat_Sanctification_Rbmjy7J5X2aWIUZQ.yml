    value: >-
      <p>You gain proficiency with martial weapons. Additionally, at the end of
      a long rest, you can turn flasks of water into flasks of holy water
      through a special ritual. You can create a number of flasks of holy water
      this way equal to your proficiency bonus. Any flasks created this way lose
      their divine power when you complete your next long rest. </p><p>You can
      throw or splash holy water using the bonus action granted by your Cunning
      Action. When you do so, you can add your proficiency to attacks made using
      holy water as an improvised weapon. Alternatively, you can use your
      Cunning Action to apply holy water to a weapon you are carrying. When you
      do so, your Sneak Attack damage becomes radiant damage for 1 minute.</p>
