  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You call forth a spirit to aid you with your ability checks. Choose one
      skill out of Arcana, Animal Handling, History, Investigation, Medicine,
      Nature, Perception, Religion, or Survival. The spirit is proficient in the
      chosen skill. It is ethereal and ephemeral and cannot interact with
      physical objects, but can provide guidance on matters relating to chosen
      skill.</p><p>For the duration, you can treat any check you make in the
      skill as if you have proficiency with it so long as the spirit can
      communicate with you. Alternatively, the spirit can make Intelligence or
      Wisdom checks itself, with a +5 modifier. The spirit will follow you,
      staying within of you at all times. You can choose to release it early,
      dismissing it back from whence it came.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level
      or higher, the spiritâ€™s bonus on making ability checks directly increases
      by 1 for each slot level above 1st, up to a maximum of +9.</p>
