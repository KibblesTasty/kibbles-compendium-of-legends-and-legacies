      <p>Starting at 6th level, once per turn on your turn when you roll damage
      with an illusion spell, you can add your Charisma modifier to the damage
      roll.</p><p> Additionally, once per turn when a creature interacts with
      one of your illusions you can choose deal psychic damage equal to your
      charisma modifier to them (such as destroying a mirror image, inspecting
      an a major image, or being bite by vicious hound). If they make a check or
      save to determine the reality of the illusion that has damage them that
      turn, it is made with disadvantage</p>
