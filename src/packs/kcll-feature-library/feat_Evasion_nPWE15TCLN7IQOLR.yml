    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 15th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain
      area effects. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make
      a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
      damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you
      fail.</p>
