      <p>At 3rd level, when you cast
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{find familiar}, your
      familiar gains an Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma of 10 (unless that
      respective score is already greater) and the ability to speak any
      languages you speak. When your familiar takes damage, you can choose to
      take that damage yourself instead, transferring all damage to
      you.</p><p>Additionally, you can cast spells with a material component if
      your familiar can access the material component without holding it
      yourself (including curse spells that can acquire the material component
      by touching the target creature).</p>
