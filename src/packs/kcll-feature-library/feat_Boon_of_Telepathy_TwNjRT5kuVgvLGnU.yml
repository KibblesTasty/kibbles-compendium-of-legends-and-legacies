    value: >-
      <p>You sacrifice a 4th-level spell slot, gaining the power to communicate
      telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You
      donâ€™t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your
      telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at
      least one language. Creatures you communicate with can reply in kind.</p>
