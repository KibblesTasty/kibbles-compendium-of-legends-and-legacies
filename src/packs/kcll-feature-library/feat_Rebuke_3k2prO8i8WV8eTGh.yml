    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 15th level, when a creature within your Aura of Serenity
      attempts to speak, attack, or cast a spell, you can rebuke them as a
      reaction, causing them to take radiant damage equal to your Charisma
      modifier and forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
      saving throw their attempt to speak fails, and they are silenced until the
      start of their next turn.</p>
