    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 18th level, your allies will never fall so long as their
      symbol of hope remains. When a friendly creature within 60 feet of you is
      reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, they can drop to 1 hit
      point instead so long as they can see or hear you.</p>

      <p>Once a creature benefits from this effect, they cannot benefit from it
      again until they complete a long rest.</p>
