    value: >-
      <p>When you make a grapple check, you can expend a ki point to add your
      Martial Arts die to the roll. You can do this after the contested roll,
      and it can potentially turn a failure into a success. On success, the
      target takes damage equal to amount rolled on the added die.</p>
