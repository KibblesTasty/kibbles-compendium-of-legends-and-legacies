    value: >-
      <p>You cause a series of giant bones to burst from the earth around a
      point you can see on the ground within range. The bones form a dome in a
      10-foot radius around the target point. Small or larger creatures cannot
      pass through the cage, and attacks that deal bludgeoning or slashing
      damage cannot be made through it. The cage functions as half cover against
      other attacks or spells that pass through it.</p><p>The cage has 40 hit
      points, AC 13, and is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage. If it is reduced
      to 0 hit points, it crumbles to dust and the spell ends.</p><p><strong>At
      Higher Levels.</strong> When cast with a 5th level or higher spell slot,
      the cage has an additional 10 hit points for each level above 4th.</p>
