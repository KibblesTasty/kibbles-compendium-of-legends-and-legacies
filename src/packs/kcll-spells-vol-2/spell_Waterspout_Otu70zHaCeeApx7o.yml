    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a large mass of water and form it into a whirling funnel
      around a point on the ground you can see. The funnel fills a 10-foot
      radius, 30-foot high cylinder. If a creature enters the waterspout on its
      turn or the waterspout moves into the creature's space, the creature must
      make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 2d8 bludgeoning
      damage and is &amp;Reference[blinded], &amp;Reference[deafened], and
      cannot speak. At the start of its next turn, it is expelled from the
      waterspout to the nearest empty space. On a success, it takes half as much
      damage and suffers none of the spell’s other effects.</p><p>On your turn,
      you can use a bonus action to move the waterspout up to 20 feet in any
      direction along the ground, engulfing any creatures in its path. A
      creature that fails its save after being engulfed by the waterspout in
      this way is carried along with its movement until they it is ejected at
      the start of its turn.</p><p>If the center point of this spell is over a
      Huge or larger body of water, the size of the waterspout is doubled.</p>
