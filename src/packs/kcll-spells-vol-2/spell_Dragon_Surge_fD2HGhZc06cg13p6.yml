    value: >-
      <p>You channel elemental power to form draconic wings, selecting one of
      the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Each
      creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw as the
      wings manifest, taking 2d8 damage of that chosen type on a failure, or
      half as much on a success. You gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the
      end of your turn, after which the wings fade away.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level
      or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and the flying speed increases by
      10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
