      <p>You assume the form of the familiar that provided the material
      component to the spell. This transformation lasts for the duration or
      until you drop to 0 hit points or die. Your game statistics are replaced
      by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment
      and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.</p><p>You assume the hit
      points and hit dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form,
      you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If
      you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage
      carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t
      reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
      You can use an action to revert to your normal form at any time.</p><p>
      You are limited in the actions you can perform by the nature of your new
      form, and you can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that
      requires hands or speech. Your gear melds into the new form. You cannot
      activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of your equipment.</p>
