    value: >-
      <p>The march of death is inexorable. Necrotic damage you deal ignores
      resistance to Necrotic damage, and treats immunity as resistance, and
      leaves the touch of death on the target until the start of your next turn.
      While under the Touch of Death, any hit points the target regains is
      halved (rounded down).</p>
