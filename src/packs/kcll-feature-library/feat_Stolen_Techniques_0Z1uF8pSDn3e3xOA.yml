      <p>At 6th level, you can learn one new 1st or 2nd level spell from the
      Cleric, Bard, Druid, or Wizard spell list. The spell becomes an Occultist
      spell for you, but does not count against your spells known.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can delve the rites of another tradition. You learn
      one additional Occult Rite that does not count against your rites known.
      This rite can be selected from any occultist subclass or from the general
      Occultist Rites, but cannot be a rite with a prerequisite.</p>
