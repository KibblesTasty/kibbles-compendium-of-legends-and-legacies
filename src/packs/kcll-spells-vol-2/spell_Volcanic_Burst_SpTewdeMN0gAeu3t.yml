    value: >-
      <p>You call fiery forces from below the earth to violently erupt,
      designating a point you can see within range to explode with magma. The
      ground in a 10-foot radius around the point explodes in a shower of fire
      and rock, raining down in a 20-foot radius. Every creature in the 20-foot
      radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 4d10
      bludgeoning damage and 4d6 fire damage. If a creature in the inner 10-foot
      radius fails its save, it is additionally flung 10 feet up into the air,
      taking normal falling damage (1d6 bludgeoning damage) and falling
      &amp;Reference[prone] when it lands. On a successful save, a creature
      takes half damage and suffers no additional effects.</p><p>The inner
      10-foot radius becomes difficult terrain until cleared by hand. Each
      5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by
      hand.</p>
