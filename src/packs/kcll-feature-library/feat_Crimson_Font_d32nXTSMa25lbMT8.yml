    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, when you cast a blood magic spell, you can contribute hit
      points of blood up to your Warden Level to the spell without taking
      damage. Any hit points contributed beyond that reduce your hit points as
      normal.</p><p> Additionally, you are immune to any effect that drains your
      blood, makes you take damage from bleeding, or causes effects that involve
      bleeding. You are not immune to the damage that makes you bleed.</p>
