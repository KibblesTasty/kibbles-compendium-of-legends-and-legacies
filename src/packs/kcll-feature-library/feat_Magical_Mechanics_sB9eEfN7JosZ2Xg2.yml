      <p>Starting at 6th level, your understanding of the mechanics behind
      magical effects and the cosmic forces are developed enough that if you see
      a spell being cast, you can use your reaction to make an Arcana check to
      know what the spell is. If the spell you identify with this check would
      force you to make a saving throw, you can make that saving throw with
      advantage.</p><p>Additionally, your comprehension of magic allows you to
      access magic that is beyond your power, but not beyond your knowledge. You
      can cast from a Spell Scroll even if the spell isn’t on your spell list,
      and you can add your proficiency bonus to the ability check to
      successfully cast from a Spell Scroll.</p>
