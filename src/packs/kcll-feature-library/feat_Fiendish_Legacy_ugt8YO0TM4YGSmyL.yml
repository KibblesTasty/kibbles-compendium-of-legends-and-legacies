      <p>At 1st level, you learn Infernal or Abyssal. This choice is most often
      tied to the origin of your fiendish powers. </p><p>Additionally, when your
      Spellcasting feature lets you learn a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell
      of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the warlock
      spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the
      spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.</p>
