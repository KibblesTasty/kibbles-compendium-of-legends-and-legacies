    value: >-
      <p>As you delve into your Tradition of occult magic, you find deviations
      and branches to explore that help you specialize and perfect your craft in
      the way that best suits you.</p><p>At 2nd Level, you gain two Occult Rites
      of your choice. Your Occult Rites options are detailed at the end of the
      subclass description for subclass specific Rites, and at the end of the
      class description for general Rites, you can select from either you
      subclass or class list. When you gain certain Occultist levels, you gain
      additional Occult Rites of your choice.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain
      a level in this class, you can choose one of the Occult Rites you know and
      replace it with another Occult Rites that you could learn at that level. A
      level prerequisite in an Occult Rite refers to Occultist level, not
      character level.</p><blockquote><h3><strong>Class &amp; Subclass
      Rites</strong></h3><p>Each subclass has specific rites that only they can
      select, and for each subclass, these are added to the pool of rites with
      the class rites you can select. You can select from either list when you
      are selecting a new rite.</p></blockquote>
