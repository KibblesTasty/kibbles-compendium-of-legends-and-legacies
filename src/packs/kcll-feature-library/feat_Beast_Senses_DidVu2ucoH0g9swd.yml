    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 10th level, your bond with your companion enhances your
      senses with it, and its senses with yours. You gain expertise in
      Perception, allowing you to add twice your proficiency modifier to ability
      checks made for that skill, you gain any darkvision or blindsight range
      your beast has, and it gains any darkvision or blindsight range you have
      (if both of you already have one type of vision, the ranges are added
      together).</p>
