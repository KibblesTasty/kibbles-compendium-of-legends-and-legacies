      arms as a bonus action.
      </p><p>@UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feature-library.Item.euUAu06eYIYDNIiv]{Astral
      Arm}</p><p>These arms last until you fall unconscious or you dismiss them
      as a bonus action. The maximum number of arms you can form increases to 4
      at 9th level, and 6 at 17th level. The number of arms do not affect the
      number of attacks you can make, but the arms can be used to grapple
      creatures.</p><p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can
      make a single unarmed strike or grapple check with one of your Astral Arms
      as a bonus action.</p>
