      <p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can form orbiting motes
      from Star Shards into Constellations that empower you with astral powers.
      A Constellation can be broken up at any time (no action required)
      returning the component motes and ending the effect of the Constellation.
      Forming a new Constellation while you already have one active breaks apart
      the previously formed Constellation. The forms of the Constellations vary
      from wizard to wizard, representing intricacies of beliefs and magic, but
      always take the form of stars from the planet they are on, just connected
      in unique ways. You can form the following
      Constellations:</p><ul><li><strong>Constellation of Nightfall (2
      Motes).</strong> While this Constellation is active, you gain darkvision
      with a range of 60 feet.</li><li><strong>Constellation of Navigation (2
      Motes).</strong> While this Constellation is active, you gain the benefits
      of your
      @UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feature-library.Item.EMqcXSNFACz1Dcvz]{Astral
      Orrery}; moving does not dismiss it.</li><li><strong>Constellation of the
      Eye (3 Motes).</strong> While the Constellation is active, you gain
      advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.</li><li><strong>Constellation of
      Mystery (3 Motes).</strong> While this Constellation is active, you gain
      advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks.</li><li><strong>Constellation
      of Brilliance (4 Motes).</strong> While the Constellation is active, when
      you cast a spell that deals damage you can choose to have it deal radiant
      damage instead of its normal damage type.</li><li><strong>Constellation of
      the Void (4 motes).</strong> While this Constellation is active all
      creatures of your choice within 20 feet of you gain resistance to radiant
      damage.</li><li><strong>Constellation of the Messenger (5 Motes).</strong>
      While this Constellation is active, you gain a flying speed of 30
      feet.</li><li><strong>Constellation of the Shield (5 motes).</strong>
      While this Constellation is active, you gain half cover against
      attacks.</li></ul><p>While you have a Constellation formed, you shed 5
      feet of dim light for each mote forming the constellation. Any formed
      Constellation fades when you complete a long rest.</p>
