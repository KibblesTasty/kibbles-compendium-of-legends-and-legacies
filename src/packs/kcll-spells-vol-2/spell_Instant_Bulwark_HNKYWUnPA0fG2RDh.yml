    value: >-
      <p>You cause a 15-foot-long, 10-foot-tall, 6-inch thick wall of earth to
      erupt from the ground in an empty space you can see within range. The wall
      grants total cover and blocks any damage originating from the far side of
      the wall. It blocks ranged attacks and any area-ofeffect spells or magical
      effects with areas intersecting the wall.</p><p>The wall has hit points
      equal to 4d10 + your spellcasting modifier. It takes all damage it blocks,
      even if that damage normally only affects creatures, but it only suffers
      the blocked damage one time even if it protects multiple creatures. If it
      is reduced to 0 hit points, it crumbles to dust and any excess damage is
      dealt as normal. If the wall is not destroyed, it crumbles at the start of
      your next turn.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the wall has 1d10
      additional hit points and is 5 feet longer for each level above 3rd.</p>
