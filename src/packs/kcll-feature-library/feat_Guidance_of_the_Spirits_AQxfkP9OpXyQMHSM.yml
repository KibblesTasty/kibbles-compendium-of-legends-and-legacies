      <p><em>(Prerequisite: 3rd level Shaman)</em></p><p>When you expend a spell
      slot to empower a spirit with your Empowered Spirits feature, you can
      select a number of skills equal to the spell slot level expended that the
      spirit is proficient in. While it is not manifested, you gain proficiency
      with these skills. If you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you
      can exchange three skill proficiencies to gain expertise in one skill.</p>
