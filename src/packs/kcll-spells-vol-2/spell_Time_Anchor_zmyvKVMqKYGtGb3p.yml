    value: >-
      <p>You place a temporal marker on an object. For the duration, you can
      activate that marker, bringing the object to your hand and calling it
      forward in time from the moment you cast the spell. When you do so, the
      current timeline is unaltered, except that the object disappears from its
      present location. </p><p>The object appears in the its exact state from
      the time the spell was cast, including its condition, charges, and other
      properties. The object appears even if it has been consumed or destroyed
      in the intervening time.</p><p>You can only have one object anchored to
      you at a time. Once this spell has been cast on an object, it can never be
      cast on the same object again.</p>
