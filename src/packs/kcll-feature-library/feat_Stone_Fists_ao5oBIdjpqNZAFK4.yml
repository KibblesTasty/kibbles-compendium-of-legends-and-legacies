      <p>Starting at 1st level, when you roll initiative or as a bonus action at
      any time, you can transform one or both arms into durable forms of living
      stone. You cannot wield weapons or shields in hands that you have turned
      to stone, but they can be used to grapple creatures.</p><p>While you are
      grappling a creature with your stone fists, that fist can only attack that
      creature. The stone form lasts until you dismiss them as a bonus
      action.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feature-library.Item.iX0GwM8r98O2FCmk]{Stone
