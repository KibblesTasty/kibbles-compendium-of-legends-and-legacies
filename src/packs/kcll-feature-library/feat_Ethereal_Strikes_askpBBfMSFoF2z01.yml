    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 15th level, when you gain advantage from Advantageous
      Surge, your blade sweeps through all enemy defenses. You ignore all
      non-magical armor and defenses to treat their AC as 10 + their dexterity
      for that attack (magical defenses like mage armor or shield are not
      bypassed)</p>
