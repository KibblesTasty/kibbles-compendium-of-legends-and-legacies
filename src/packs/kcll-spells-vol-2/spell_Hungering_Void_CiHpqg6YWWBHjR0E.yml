    value: >-
      <p>You gesture at a point you can see within range and summon a 20-foot
      radius sphere of blackness, a void of magical darkness which attempts to
      devour whatever enters. Darkvision cannot penetrate it, and no light can
      illuminate the darkness unless caused by a spell of a higher
      level.</p><p>A creature that starts its turn within the void must make a
      Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 2d6 cold damage and 2d6
      necrotic damage, and its speed is reduced by 5 feet to a minimum of 5
      feet. This speed reduction stacks with successive failures, and ends once
      the creature starts its turn outside the void. On a success, the creature
      takes half as much damage and its speed is not reduced.</p><p><strong>At
      Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th
      level or higher, the necrotic and cold damage both increase by 1d6, and
      the speed reduction increases to 10 feet for each failed save.</p>
