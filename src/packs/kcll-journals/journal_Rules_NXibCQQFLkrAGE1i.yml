        <h5>Curse Spell Material Components </h5><p>All curse spells require
        “something from the target creature—such as blood, hair, or scales—which
        the spell consumes” as the material component. This can be satisfied by
        either by having that material, or being in range to touch the creature
        while casting the spell. </p><h5>Upcasting curses </h5><p>All curses
        with no upcasting trait gain the following upcasting text: "At Higher
        Levels. If you use a 9th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is
        dispelled and grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration."
        </p><h5>Remove Curse Interaction </h5><p>The remove curse spell cast a
        level equal to higher than the level of the curse spell ends the effect
        of any curse spell.</p>

        <p>Blood magic is a special category of spells which drain the vitality
        of living creatures to cast magic. Blood magic might not always be
        considered evil, but you should consult with your DM about local
        attitudes toward blood magic in their setting.</p><p>Blood Magic may not
        be for everyone and frequently involves gore and themes of self-harm; be
        sure to consult with everyone at your table to make sure this content is
        suitable for your game.</p><h3>Limited Availability</h3><p>Blood magic
        is not restricted by any special feat or requirement, but your DM may
        rule that there are special requirements to learn blood magic. The only
        inherent restriction is that the
        @UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feats.Item.CoKlm2Nw45uwDMHm]{Hemomancer}
        feat is required to cast spells using only your hit points (bypassing
        spell slots).</p><h3>Blood Components</h3><p>Blood magic spells all have
        a material component that reads "a drop [or splash] of blood worth [X]
        hit points". If a material component is "up to X" hit points, you can
        choose to spend as little as 1 hit point, or up to the full amount
        listed.</p><p>When you cast a blood magic spell, you take damage equal
        to the hit points required for the spell, which you can draw as part of
        casting the spell (no additional action required). These hit points must
        come from you, unless you have features or feats that allow you to use
        other sources of blood to power your magic.</p><p>If you cast a blood
        magic spell with a higher-level spell slot, the minimum hit point cost
        increases to the slot level used.</p><p>You cannot use blood magic if
        doing so would reduce you to 0 hit
        points.</p><fieldset><legend><strong>Foundry
        Note</strong></legend><p>This is represented by adding
        <code>attributes.hp.value</code> to the consumption field and adding
        scaling.</p></fieldset><h3>Blood Damage</h3><p>Damage taken from casting
        blood magic reduces your current hit points and bypasses any temporary
        hit points or damage reduction you have (as you need blood to power the
        spell).</p><h3>Concentration</h3><p>Many blood magic spells lack the
        concentration requirements of normal spells. This is intentional, and
        part of what makes them appealing options for unscrupulous casters.
        Blood mages often take small amounts of damage when casting their
        spells, which might break their concentration—so it's important for them
        to have good options available that don't require concentration.</p>

        <p>Feats for monsters are tools that allow you turn a generic monster
        into a more elite or specialized version of that monster with a simple
        drag-and-drop new ability. Each feat is designed to give the monster a
        straightforward new power that makes encountering it a slight
        twist.</p><p>While replacing monsters entirely with more complicated
        monsters with detailed movesets works in some cases (and this very book
        includes some such monsters), many times simple generic monsters fit the
        bill. You don’t want every creature on the battlefield doing complicated
        things every turn, as it grinds combat to a halt. But you might want one
        or two elites or champions to mix things up, and these represent a way
        to turn any monster into those in just moments.</p><p>Monster feats are
        great for the little battles in between the set pieces. While making a
        custom monster from scratch or scouring your pile of favorite monster
        source books for the perfect epic encounter can make sense for a
        capstone, sometimes you just want an orc bandit with a bit more cleaving
        or a wolf that surprises your players with a sudden leap to their tasty
        looking backline character.</p><p>Monster feats give you a way to have
        these little twists and bumps without them feeling ad-hoc or arbitrary,
        especially as many of them are mechanics that players will recognize
        from the Active Martial Feats available to them. Things always seem more
        fair if the Player Characters can theoretically gain the same powers,
        and it might even motivate them to take one of them as their next feat
        after seeing it in action.</p><p>This is why they are called ‘monster
        feats’ rather than ‘monster powers’. It gives players a sense of ‘oh
        that’s why this monster can do this thing, it has a feat’ without
        devolving fully to using Player Character rules to build
        monsters.</p><blockquote><h5>Comparison to Player Feats</h5><p>One might
        be tempted to ask at this point ‘why not just the player facing Active
        Martial Feats?’ Indeed, that’s where this started, as that proved a
        popular idea. But monster feats have somewhat different
        considerations.</p><p>For player feats, any two feats should be roughly
        balanced against the other options. You don’t want a gradient of power
        in the feats, because you don’t want ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ options, and
        they have equal opportunity cost to the player. For monster feats, there
        is no opportunity cost to the feat, so the balance is a lever the DM
        pulls rather than an absolute, so having a gradient of tools from minor
        to ‘overpowered’ is a feature of the design, rather than a
        problem.</p></blockquote><h3>Proficiency Scaling</h3><p>One aspect of
        these feats is that they scale with the proficiency bonus. This is to
        make sure they remain relevant across all levels of play, but can cause
        some confusion as not all monsters list their proficiency bonus. While
        on newer monsters it will be listed as “PB” most frequently, it might
        not appear on older monsters at all.</p><p>Fortunately, the PB of a
        monster can be reverse engineered from their CR, simply by treating
        their CR as if it were the level of a player character. To make that
        more clear, here’s a graph that you can quickly reference to determine
        the proficiency bonus based on CR. Note that the CR adjustment of an
        added monster feat should not be taken into account when determining the
        proficiency bonus—they are added after all the math of a creature is
        ‘baked’ in.</p><table><caption>Monster Proficiency Bonus
        Reference</caption><thead><tr><th>Challenge Rating
        (CR)</th><th>Proficiency Bonus
        (PB)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1–4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>5–8</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>9–12</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>13–17</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>18–21</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>22–25</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>26–28</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>29–30</td><td>9</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>CR
        Adjustment</h3><p>Each feat contains a rough CR adjustment, but in the
        balance between this being accurate and simple, I’ve opted to make it
        simple. This means that while the CR adjustment will give you a
        reasonable grasp of how it might impact the encounter, it cannot account
        for all the variables that might be at play across a wide range of
        levels.</p><p>The best approach is to start using these conservatively.
        Try one out here or there in what would otherwise be an easy fight and
        get used to them. The best encounter building technique is experience in
        building encounters.</p><p>With any group, balance is will always be as
        much as an art as a science, because players do not play predictable or
        optimally (or not predictably optimally) so balancing monster statistics
        against player statistics is only half the job (assuming you are trying
        to build an encounter that challenges them, but has a low chance of
        ending the campaign).</p><p>If a CR adjustment is 1/2, the CR is only
        adjusted if the monster’s CR is less than 1 (rounding to 1 if the
        monster is CR 1/4). The CR adjustment for Dynamic Feats are less
        concrete.</p><p>Adding multiple new feats does not necessarily increase
        the monster’s CR in a linear fashion. And CR adjustments after the first
        can be treated as half the listed value. This is because the monster’s
        action economy and defensive CR will typically be unable to fully
        utilize multiple feats, but adding multiple feats is not recommended
        until you have some experience with their
        application.</p><h3>Interaction with Multiattack</h3><p>Many monster
        feats that grant a new way to attack will read ‘as part of its
        multiattack action’. This means that it can replace any attack the
        monster can take as part of the multiattack action.</p><p>When using the
        feat conservatively, you can replace the monsters strongest attack with
        the new action, but the CR adjustment and assumption of the feat is that
        it can replace any attack the monster can take as part of the
        multiattack action, typically replacing one of its weaker attacks (if it
        has stronger and weaker attacks).</p><blockquote><h5>Monster Feats In
        Action</h5><p>Using Monster Feats can help make enemies do unexpected
        things that keep combat fresh and dynamic, but tend to go over best when
        introduced in a few a time, letting the players get the hang of the new
        tools that monsters might be able to engage against them.</p><p>It can
        also help to make their recharge more transparent, such as rolling the
        recharge die in public after the monster attacks. This lets players have
        knowledge of what the monster can do that, but this knowledge doesn’t
        exceed what the player could plausibly read from the combat situation
        after seeing the monster exert themselves into a special
        attack.</p><p>Sometimes the best solution is simply to let players know
        a monster is an elite monster using special powers if they are used
        monsters with more limited power sets, and after some time they’ll
        simply come to expect that a monster with a fancier helmet might break
        out some special abilities compared to a normal
        variant.</p></blockquote>
