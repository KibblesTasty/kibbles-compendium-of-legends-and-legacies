      <p>You master using a whip, gaining the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score Bonus.</strong> Increase your
      Strength, Dexterity or Constitution ability score by 1, to a maximum of
      20.</li><li><strong>Expert Handling.</strong> Whips gain the Light
      property for you and you can use a whip to extend your reach for certain
      object interactions, such as opening and closing doors, picking up
      objects, or similar simple interactions.</li><li>You gain the Whip Tricks
      special attacks.</li></ul><h5 id="whip-tricks">Whip Tricks</h5><p>You
      master the manipulation of a whip to allow a level of extreme control over
      its use.</p><p>When you make a weapon attack with a whip, you can replace
      the attack with a trick, forcing the enemy to make a Dexterity saving
      throw saving with a DC of 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your
      choice) + your proficiency bonus. If the target fails its saving throw,
      you can perform any of the following tricks against
      it:</p><ul><li><strong>Sudden Yank.</strong> You wrap the whip around a
      Medium or smaller target, and yank them 5 feet towards
      you.</li><li><strong>Tangle Weapon.</strong> You tangle one weapon the
      target is wielding, giving them disadvantage on attacks with that weapon
      until the start of your next turn, or until they miss an attack. You
      cannot make attacks with the whip used to make the attack until they free
      the weapon.</li><li><strong>Whip Trip.</strong> You tangle a Large or
      smaller creatureâ€™s feet, causing them to fall
      &amp;Reference[prone].</li></ul>
