    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, your research into the synthesis of divine and
      arcane reveals to you a greater harmony of power. When you cast a 1st
      level or higher spell from the Wizard spell list or a spell from the
      Cleric spell list as your action, you can cast a 1st level or higher spell
      from the other list with a casting time of an action or bonus action as a
      bonus action (regardless of its casting time).</p><p>The total level of
      the two spells combined cannot exceed your half your Wizard level (rounded
      down).</p>
