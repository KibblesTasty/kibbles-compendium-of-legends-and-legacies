    value: >-
      <p><em>(Prerequisite: 12th level Witch)</em></p><p>You infuse an object -
      traditionally a broom, but can be any vaguely broom-shaped object (like a
      spear, staff, or similar) - with flying magic, turning it into a
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.hFAVm9pTJDm0nu3g]{Broom of Flying}. If
      your broom is lost or destroyed, you can create a new one during 8 hours
      of work. If a previous broom still exists when you make a new one, it
      loses its magic upon the completion of the new one.</p>
