    value: >-
      <p>When you cast an Occultist cantrip that requires concentration, you can
      instead cause the effect to persist without concentration a number of
      rounds equal to your Occultist level (for example, as 1st level Occultist,
      it would end at the start of your next turn). You can end a spell
      persisting in this way early as an action.</p>
