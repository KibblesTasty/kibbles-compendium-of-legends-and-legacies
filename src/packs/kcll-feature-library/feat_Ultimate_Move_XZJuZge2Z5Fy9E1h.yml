      <p>Starting at 20th level, master the ultimate move of your style
      unleashing massive power in an unstoppable strike. As an attack as part of
      the Attack action, you charge your with sword mystical power before
      sending it forward in a burst of power. All creatures in 120-foot long,
      15-foot wide line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On failure, they
      take 6d6 slashing damage and 6d6 force damage. On success, they take half
      as much damage. You can exclude a number of creatures from the area of
      effect equal to your Intelligence modifier ([[lookup
      @abilities.int.mod]]).</p><p>If the sword was infused with spell that has
      an area of effect through Spellstrike when you made this attack (for
      example fireball), the spells area of effect becomes the area of effect of
      this ability (otherwise the spell is discharged against the first target,
      treating a failed save as a Spellstrike hit).</p><p>Once you use this
      ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
