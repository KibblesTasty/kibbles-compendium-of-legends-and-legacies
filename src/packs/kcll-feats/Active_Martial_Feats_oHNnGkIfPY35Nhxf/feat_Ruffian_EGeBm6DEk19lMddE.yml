      <p>You have turned kicking people when they're down into an art form. You
      gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution by
      1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Painful Critical.</strong> When you
      score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack against a creature, it
      must make a Constitution saving throw or become blinded or dazedâ€  until
      the start of your next turn. This does not affect undead, constructs, or
      other creatures that can feel no pain.</li><li>Gain the Dirty Strike
      special ability (below)</li></ul><h5 id="dirty-strike">Dirty
      Strike</h5><p><em>Active Ability (Special)</em></p><p>When you make a
      melee weapon attack, you can follow up with a dirty trick (a knee to the
      gut, handful of sand to eyes, etc.). The creature must make a Constitution
      saving throw. On failure, they become your choice of
      &amp;Reference[blinded] or &amp;Reference[dazed] (your choice) for 1
      minute. The target can repeat its saving throw at the end of each of their
      turns. A creature can spend their action treating their condition to
      automatically pass the saving throw. Once you use this against a target
      once, they are ready for subsequent attempts and automatically pass saving
      throws against it.</p><p>Once you use this feature to successfully blind
      or daze a creature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or
      long rest.</p>
