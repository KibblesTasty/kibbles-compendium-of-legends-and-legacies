      <p>You move like the wind, striking faster than your foes can see. You
      gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution
      score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Battlefield
      Dancer.</strong> Each time you hit a creature, your movement speed
      increases by 5 feet until the end of your turn. If you attack and hit a
      creature with a melee weapon attack, you can pass through its space,
      treating it as difficult terrain.</li><li>Gain the Slashing Dash special
      attack (below)</li></ul><h5 id="slashing-dash">Slashing
      Dash</h5><p><em>Active Ability (Attack)</em></p><p>When you take the
      Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a
      rapid burst of movement, moving up to 30 feet along any surface in a
      straight line.</p><p>You can move on vertical or horizontal surfaces with
      this movement, can pass through creatures, and do not provoke attacks of
      opportunity, but cannot pass through objects or terrain. If you are
      carrying a weapon you are proficient with when you take this action, each
      time you pass through a creature, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
      creature takes 2d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
      damage of your weapon type on a failed save, or half as much on a
      successful save. The number of d6 increases by one when your proficiency
      bonus increases (with the total number of d6 equaling your proficiency
      bonus).</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you
      complete a short or long rest.</p>
