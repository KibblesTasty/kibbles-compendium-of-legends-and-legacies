    value: >-
      <p>You cause the earth to ripple, triggering an avalanche of rock and
      stone to surge forward in a line 60 feet long and 15 feet wide. The length
      of the line is doubled if cast on a steeply sloped surface. Each creature
      caught in the surging tumble of rocks must make a Dexterity saving throw.
      On a failure, a creature takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked
      &amp;Reference[prone]. On a failure by 5 or more, it is
      &amp;Reference[stunned] until the end of its next turn, and on a failure
      by 10 or more it is moved to the closest free space at the end of the line
      created by the spell. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much
      damage and suffers none of the spellâ€™s other effects. The spell creates a
      15 by 15 foot area of difficult terrain at the end of the line created by
      the spell.</p><p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
      slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot
      level above 6th.</p>
